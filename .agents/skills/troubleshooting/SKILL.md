# ComfyUI Troubleshooting Guide

> Render completes but looks WRONG (artifacts, wrong subject/pose/color, a
> ControlNet/mask/LoRA not taking, a refiner degrading it)? That's not an error.
> Use the debug-render skill (`list_packs` with `action: "skill_read"`,
> `name: "debug-render"`) to localize the bad stage with run-to-node
> (`panel_run` `to_node_id`) by previewing intermediate steps. This guide is for
> runs that fail with an error, OOM, or missing node.

## Error Diagnosis Strategy

When a workflow fails, follow this approach:

1. Get the error. Use `get_history(action="diagnose")` to retrieve the execution result with the full traceback, plus any missing models/nodes
2. Check logs. Use `get_system_stats (action:"logs")` with keyword filters like `"error"`, `"warning"`, `"traceback"`
3. Identify the failing node. The history response includes the `node_id` and `node_type` that failed
4. Cross-reference inputs. Use `create_workflow (action:"node_info")` to verify the failing node's expected input schema
5. Check models. Use `list_local_models` to verify all referenced model files exist

## Out of Memory (OOM)

### Error Pattern

```
torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate X MiB.
GPU 0 has a total capacity of 24.00 GiB of which X MiB is free.
```

Or:

```
RuntimeError: CUDA error: out of memory
```

### Root Cause

The GPU does not have enough VRAM to hold the model weights, intermediate tensors, and latent images at the same time. Common triggers:
- High resolution images (2048x2048+)
- Multiple models loaded at the same time
- FP32 precision models on limited VRAM
- Video generation (LTXV, AnimateDiff) with many frames
- Large batch sizes

### Fixes (in order of preference)

1. Reduce resolution. Drop to the model's native resolution (512 for SD 1.5, 1024 for SDXL/Flux)
2. Use FP8/FP16 quantized models. FP8 Flux models use ~8GB vs ~24GB for FP16
   - Search for FP8 variants: `download_model({ action: "search", query: "flux fp8" })` or the same with `"sdxl fp8"`
3. Launch flags (the VRAM ladder). Offload via ComfyUI CLI flags:
   - `--lowvram` offloads text encoders / model parts to CPU
   - `--novram` is extreme offload, the go-to for long video (LTX 2 / WAN) OOM
   - `--cache-none` caches nothing (lowest RAM/VRAM); combine with `--novram`
   - `--reserve-vram N` reserves N GB so the GPU stops spilling into slow shared VRAM (Windows); typical `2` to `4`
   - `--disable-smart-memory` forces offload to RAM when a run gets stuck or OOMs intermittently
   - Full matrix and recipes: [`comfyui-launch-flags`](../comfyui-launch-flags/SKILL.md)
4. Free VRAM between generations. ComfyUI should auto-manage, but restarting clears leaked memory
5. Use tiled VAE decoding. For high-resolution images, tile the VAE decode step
   - Node: `VAEDecodeTiled` instead of `VAEDecode`
   - Breaks the image into tiles, decodes each separately, and stitches them together
6. Reduce batch size. Set batch_size to 1 in `EmptyLatentImage`
7. Avoid multiple models. Don't load two full checkpoints at the same time; use one checkpoint and LoRAs instead
8. For LTXV/video: always use FP8 quantized video models on 24GB cards

### VRAM Estimates

| Model | FP32 | FP16 | FP8 |
|-------|------|------|-----|
| SD 1.5 | ~4GB | ~2GB | ~1GB |
| SDXL | ~12GB | ~6GB | ~3GB |
| Flux Dev | ~48GB | ~24GB | ~12GB |
| Flux Schnell | ~48GB | ~24GB | ~12GB |
| LTXV | ~20GB+ | ~10GB+ | ~6GB |

## Launch Flags — VRAM / Cache / Attention / Precision

ComfyUI's startup flags tune the speed↔VRAM tradeoff. Match them to the detected
GPU (the panel orchestrator reports VRAM/GPU/torch/sage in its env block; pick the
tier from there). Set them on the process that launches ComfyUI (or the
`--panel-orchestrator` / `connect` command's ComfyUI, not the agent).

### VRAM mode (pick ONE by card size)

| Flag | Card | Behavior |
|------|------|----------|
| `--gpu-only` | 16GB+ | Everything (CLIP/VAE/UNet) stays on GPU — fastest, max VRAM |
| `--highvram` | 12–16GB | Models stay resident in GPU after use, no CPU offload |
| `--normalvram` | 8–12GB | Default balance — unload to CPU RAM when idle |
| `--lowvram` | 6–8GB | Split the UNet, aggressive CPU offload — slower |
| `--novram` | 4–6GB | Extreme split/offload — for OOM even on lowvram, or long videos |
| `--cpu` | <4GB / no GPU | CPU only (very slow) |

`--reserve-vram N` (GB) leaves headroom for the OS and other apps. Bump it if you
OOM intermittently mid-run (VAE decode / audio round-trips spike).

### Cache (RAM vs re-run speed)

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--cache-classic` | Default aggressive caching (fastest re-runs, most RAM) |
| `--cache-lru N` | Keep the last N node results (bounded RAM) |
| `--cache-ram N` | Cap cache to N GB of headroom |
| `--cache-none` | No caching — minimal RAM, re-runs every node |

### Attention (speed vs compatibility)

| Flag | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `--use-sage-attention` | **Recommended** — fast + efficient (needs SageAttention + Triton; see `triton-sageattention`) |
| `--use-flash-attention` | Very fast on supported GPUs |
| `--use-pytorch-cross-attention` | PyTorch 2.x native — best compatibility |
| `--use-split-cross-attention` | Lower VRAM, slower |
| `--use-quad-cross-attention` | Sub-quadratic optimization |
| (omit) | Auto-selects xFormers if available |

### Precision (UNet)

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--fp16-unet` | Half precision, ~50% VRAM |
| `--bf16-unet` | BFloat16, good balance (newer GPUs) |
| `--fp8_e4m3fn-unet` | 8-bit float, max savings (newest GPUs) |

Typical recipes:
- RTX 4090/5090 (24 to 32GB): `--gpu-only --use-sage-attention --cache-classic`
- 12 to 16GB: `--highvram --use-sage-attention` (or `--fp8_e4m3fn-unet` for big models)
- 8GB: `--normalvram --use-sage-attention --cache-lru 20`
- 6GB: `--lowvram --use-split-cross-attention --cache-none`
- OOM on long video: `--novram --reserve-vram 2`

## Device Mismatch

### Error Pattern

```
RuntimeError: Expected all tensors to be on the same device, but found at least
two devices, cuda:0 and cpu!
```

### Root Cause

A tensor on the CPU is combined with a tensor on the GPU. This usually happens when:
- A custom node doesn't move tensors to the correct device
- Model offloading placed parts of the model on CPU
- A node produces CPU tensors while downstream expects GPU tensors

### Fixes

1. Check if the error occurs with a specific custom node. Update or replace that node
2. If using `--lowvram` or `--cpu`, some nodes may not support CPU offloading
3. Restart ComfyUI to reset device state
4. Check if a custom node has a newer version that fixes device handling

## Missing Nodes

### Error Pattern

```
Cannot find node class 'NodeClassName'
```

Or in the execution response:
```
"error": {"type": "node_not_found", "message": "Cannot find node class 'X'"}
```

### Root Cause

The workflow references a node type that is not installed. This happens when:
- A custom node pack is not installed
- A custom node pack is installed but failed to load (import error)
- The node was renamed or removed in a pack update

### Fixes

1. Search for the node pack:
   ```
   search_custom_nodes(action="search", query="NodeClassName")
   ```
2. Install via ComfyUI Manager or the registry
3. Check logs for import errors:
   ```
   get_system_stats (action:"logs")(keyword="import")
   get_system_stats (action:"logs")(keyword="error")
   ```
   Import errors often reveal missing Python dependencies
4. Install missing Python dependencies. If the custom node requires a pip package:
   ```bash
   pip install missing-package
   ```
5. Restart ComfyUI after installing any custom node. Nodes are loaded at startup

## NaN Tensor Errors

### Error Pattern

```
RuntimeError: Input contains NaN
```

Or images come out as solid gray/noise with NaN warnings in logs.

### Root Cause

Numerical instability during the diffusion process. Common triggers:
- CFG scale too high. Values above 15-20 can cause numerical overflow
- Corrupted model weights. Damaged download or incompatible merge
- FP16 overflow. Some operations overflow at half precision
- Incompatible LoRA. A LoRA trained for a different base model

### Fixes

1. Lower CFG. Try CFG 7.0 for SD 1.5/SDXL, 1.0 for Flux
2. Use FP32 VAE. Some VAEs produce NaN in FP16. Switch to `vae-ft-mse-840000-ema-pruned.safetensors` (FP32)
3. Remove LoRAs. Test without LoRAs to isolate the cause
4. Re-download the model. Hash verification can detect corrupted files
5. Check LoRA compatibility. The LoRA must match the base model family

## Dtype Mismatches

### Error Pattern

```
RuntimeError: expected scalar type Float but found Half
```

Or:

```
RuntimeError: expected scalar type Half but found Float
```

Or:

```
RuntimeError: Input type (float) and bias type (c10::Half) should be the same
```

### Root Cause

A model component expects one precision (FP32/FP16) but receives another. Most common with:
- VAE precision mismatch (FP16 model + FP32 VAE or vice versa)
- Mixed-precision LoRAs
- Custom nodes that force a specific dtype

### Fixes

1. Use a separate VAE. Load an explicit FP32 VAE instead of the checkpoint's built-in VAE
   - Node: `VAELoader` with `vae-ft-mse-840000-ema-pruned.safetensors`
2. Match precision. If the model is FP16, use FP16-compatible nodes throughout
3. Force FP32 VAE decode. Some node packs offer `VAEDecodeFP32` nodes
4. Check ComfyUI settings. The `--force-fp32` flag forces everything to FP32 (uses more VRAM)

## CLIP Token Overflow

### Error Pattern

No explicit error. The prompt is truncated at 77 tokens without warning, and details mentioned late in the prompt are ignored.

### Symptoms

- Later parts of long prompts have no effect on the image
- Adding more descriptive text doesn't change the output
- Removing early tokens suddenly makes later tokens work

### Fixes

1. Use a BREAK token. Split the prompt at natural boundaries:
   ```
   subject description, pose, clothing, setting
   BREAK
   lighting, style, quality, camera angle
   ```
2. Use CLIPTextEncodeSDXL. SDXL's dual-CLIP processes two 77-token chunks
3. Prioritize important tokens. Put the most important descriptors first
4. Use fewer filler words. Remove articles and prepositions where possible
5. Use embeddings. Condense complex concepts into single tokens with textual inversions

## Black Images

### Error Pattern

No error in the execution. The workflow "succeeds" but produces completely black or near-black images.

### Root Causes and Fixes

| Cause | Diagnosis | Fix |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| `denoise = 0` | Check KSampler inputs | Set denoise to 1.0 for txt2img, 0.5-0.8 for img2img |
| `cfg = 0` | Check KSampler inputs | Set CFG to 7.0 (SD 1.5), 1.0 (Flux) |
| `steps = 0` | Check KSampler inputs | Set steps to 20+ (standard) or 4+ (turbo) |
| Wrong VAE | VAE doesn't match model | Use the correct VAE for the model family |
| Empty prompt | CLIPTextEncode has empty text | Add a text prompt |
| Wrong scheduler | Incompatible scheduler/sampler combo | Try `"normal"` scheduler with `"euler"` sampler |
| Seed collision | Extremely rare | Change the seed value |
| FP16 VAE overflow | VAE decode produces black | Use FP32 VAE or VAEDecodeTiled |

### Quick Diagnostic Checklist

1. Check `denoise` > 0 (should be 1.0 for txt2img)
2. Check `cfg` > 0 (should be 7.0 for SD 1.5, 1.0 for Flux)
3. Check `steps` > 0 (should be 20 for standard, 4 for turbo)
4. Verify the positive prompt is not empty
5. Try a different seed
6. Try a known-working sampler/scheduler combo: `euler` + `normal`

## Connection Type Errors

### Error Pattern

```
Output type 'IMAGE' doesn't match input type 'LATENT'
```

Or:

```
Required input 'model' of type 'MODEL' but got connection of type 'CLIP'
```

### Root Cause

Connecting the wrong output slot of a node to an incompatible input. Often caused by using the wrong output index.

### Fixes

1. Check output indices. Use `create_workflow (action:"node_info")` to verify the exact output order
   - `CheckpointLoaderSimple` outputs: 0=MODEL, 1=CLIP, 2=VAE
   - Getting index wrong: `["1", 0]` gives MODEL, `["1", 1]` gives CLIP
2. Verify connection format. `["nodeId", outputIndex]`, where node ID is a string and index is an integer
3. Check data type flow. The pipeline must follow the correct type chain:
   ```
   MODEL → KSampler
   CLIP → CLIPTextEncode → CONDITIONING → KSampler
   LATENT → KSampler → LATENT → VAEDecode → IMAGE
   VAE → VAEDecode, VAEEncode
   ```

## Model Loading Errors

### Error Pattern

```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'models/checkpoints/model.safetensors'
```

Or:

```
SafetensorError: Error reading file: invalid header
```

Or:

```
RuntimeError: PytorchStreamReader failed reading zip archive
```

### Root Causes

- File not found. Model file doesn't exist at the referenced path
- Corrupted download. Incomplete or damaged file
- Wrong format. File is not a valid safetensors/pickle/checkpoint format

### Fixes

1. Verify the model exists: `list_local_models({ action: "list", model_type: "checkpoints" })`
2. Check the exact filename. Model names in workflows must match the filename exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Re-download. If hash mismatch or corruption:
   ```
   download_model({ action: "download", url: "...", target_subfolder: "checkpoints" })
   ```
4. Check file size. A 1KB safetensors file is corrupted; re-download
5. Verify subfolder. Models must be in the correct subfolder (`checkpoints/`, `loras/`, `vae/`, etc.)

## Torch / CUDA Version Errors

### Error Pattern

```
RuntimeError: CUDA error: no kernel image is available for execution on the device
```

Or:

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'xxx' from 'torch'
```

Or:

```
AssertionError: Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled
```

### Root Cause

PyTorch and CUDA version incompatibility, usually after:
- Updating PyTorch without matching CUDA toolkit
- Installing a custom node that downgrades/changes PyTorch
- Using pip install that pulls a CPU-only PyTorch

### Fixes

1. Check current versions:
   ```
   get_system_stats()  # Shows PyTorch version and CUDA version
   ```
2. Verify CUDA availability. In Python: `torch.cuda.is_available()`
3. Reinstall PyTorch with CUDA. Visit pytorch.org for the correct install command matching your CUDA version
4. Pin PyTorch version. After fixing, avoid running `pip install` commands that might change PyTorch
5. Use ComfyUI's bundled venv. ComfyUI Desktop ships with a pre-configured Python environment

## ComfyUI Desktop vs CLI Differences

### Key Differences

| Aspect | ComfyUI Desktop | ComfyUI CLI |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Default port | 8000 | 8188 |
| Python | Embedded (bundled) | System/venv Python |
| Install location | `AppData/Local/Programs/ComfyUI/` | Wherever you cloned it |
| Custom nodes | `Documents/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` | `./custom_nodes/` in repo |
| Models | `Documents/ComfyUI/models/` | `./models/` in repo |
| Config | `extra_model_paths.yaml` for shared paths | Same |
| Updates | Auto-updater in the app | `git pull` |

### Common Issues

- Wrong port. MCP tools default to 8188; if using Desktop, configure for port 8000
- Path confusion. Desktop separates user data from application files
- Custom node pip installs. Desktop's embedded Python may not be on PATH; install within the venv

## Error-Specific Debugging Commands

### Workflow Failed — Get Details

```
get_history(action="list")                       # Most recent execution
get_history(action="list", prompt_id="abc-123")  # Specific execution
get_history(action="diagnose")                   # Why the last run failed
```

The response includes:
- `status.status_str`: "success" or "error"
- `status.messages`: Timestamped execution messages
- `outputs`: Node outputs (images, etc.)
- Error traceback for failed nodes

### Check Server Health

```
get_system_stats()    # GPU info, VRAM, Python/PyTorch versions
queue(action="list")  # Running and pending jobs
get_system_stats (action:"logs")(max_lines=50, keyword="error")  # Recent error logs
```

### Verify Node Availability

```
create_workflow(action="node_info", node_type="KSampler")        # Check specific node
create_workflow(action="node_info", node_type="ControlNetApply")  # Verify custom nodes loaded
```

### Verify Models

```
list_local_models({ action: "list", model_type: "checkpoints" })   # Installed checkpoints
list_local_models({ action: "list", model_type: "loras" })         # Installed LoRAs
list_local_models({ action: "list", model_type: "controlnet" })    # Installed ControlNets
```

## Quick Reference: Error to Fix

| Error Message (partial) | Most Likely Fix |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| `CUDA out of memory` | Reduce resolution, use FP8 model; VRAM ladder `--lowvram` → `--novram --cache-none` → `--reserve-vram N` ([launch flags](../comfyui-launch-flags/SKILL.md)) |
| `Expected all tensors on same device` | Update custom node, restart ComfyUI |
| `Cannot find node class` | Install the node pack, restart ComfyUI |
| `Input contains NaN` | Lower CFG, use FP32 VAE, remove LoRAs |
| `expected scalar type Float but found Half` | Use FP32 VAE, or `--force-fp32` |
| `No such file or directory` (model) | Check filename, re-download model |
| `invalid header` (safetensors) | Re-download — file is corrupted |
| `CUDA error: no kernel image` | Reinstall PyTorch with matching CUDA version |
| Black images, no error | Check denoise > 0, cfg > 0, steps > 0, prompt not empty |
| Image looks garbled/noisy | Wrong model+VAE combo, wrong sampler settings |
| `Connection refused` on port 8188 | ComfyUI not running, or using Desktop (port 8000) |
| `Prompt outputs failed validation` | Node inputs don't match schema — check `create_workflow (action:"node_info")` |
