## Your Task

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

### Instrumental Guard

When invoked with a track file path, **first check** the track's frontmatter for `instrumental: true` or the Track Details table for `**Instrumental** | Yes`. If the track is instrumental:
- **STOP** and report: "This is an instrumental track — no lyrics needed. Use `/bitwize-music:suno-engineer` to create the Style Box directly."
- Do NOT write lyrics for instrumental tracks.

### Vocal Track Workflow

When invoked with a track file path:
1. Read the track file
2. Scan existing lyrics for issues (rhyme, prosody, POV, pronunciation)
3. Report all violations with proposed fixes

When invoked with a concept:
1. Write lyrics following all quality standards below
2. Run automatic review before presenting

## Core Principles

### Watch Your Rhymes
- Don't rhyme the same word twice in consecutive lines
- Don't rhyme a word with itself
- Avoid near-repeats (mind/mind, time/time)
- Fix lazy patterns proactively

### Automatic Quality Check (13-Point)

**After writing or revising any lyrics**, automatically run through:
1. **Rhyme check**: Repeated end words, self-rhymes, lazy patterns
2. **Prosody check**: Stressed syllables align with strong beats
3. **Pronunciation check**: (a) Phonetic risks — proper nouns, homographs, acronyms, tech terms, invented contractions (no noun'd/brand'd). (b) **Table enforcement** — read Pronunciation Notes table top-to-bottom, verify every entry is applied as phonetic spelling in Suno lyrics. See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/pronunciation-guide.md` for full enforcement workflow.
4. **POV/Tense check**: Consistent throughout
5. **Source verification**: If source-based, match captured material
6. **Structure check**: Section tags, verse/chorus contrast, V2 develops
7. **Flow check**: Syllable counts consistent within verses (tolerance varies by genre), no filler phrases padding lines, no forced rhymes bending grammar.
8. **Length check**: Word count vs target duration. Check track Target Duration → album Target Duration → genre default (craft-reference.md). Over 400 words (non-hip-hop) or 600 words (hip-hop) hard fail unless target duration is 5:00+. Under 200 words — flag as likely too short and suggest adding sections (3rd verse, pre-chorus, instrumental break).
9. **Section length check**: Count lines per section, compare against genre limits (see Section Length Limits). **Hard fail** — trim any section that exceeds its genre max before presenting. Trimming strategy: identify redundant or weakest lines first, keep strongest imagery and rhymes, tighten transitions. If narrative, cut middle exposition; if descriptive, cut repeated imagery. Never cut the hook or opening line.
10. **Rhyme scheme check**: Verify rhyme scheme matches the genre (see Default Rhyme Schemes by Genre). No orphan lines, no random scheme switches mid-verse. Read each rhyming pair aloud.
11. **Density/pacing check (Suno)**: Check verse line count against genre README's `Density/pacing (Suno)` default. Cross-reference BPM/mood from Musical Direction. **Hard fail** — trim or split any verse exceeding the genre's max before presenting.
12. **Verse-chorus echo check**: Compare last 2 lines of every verse against first 2 lines of the following chorus. Flag exact phrases, shared rhyme words, restated hooks, or shared signature imagery. Check ALL verse-to-chorus and bridge-to-chorus transitions.
13. **Pitfalls check**: Run through checklist

Report any violations found. Don't wait to be asked.

### Iterative Refinement Passes

After the 13-point quality check, run refinement passes to tighten and polish the draft.

**Configuration**: Default 1 pass. User-configurable 0–3. If user requests >3, warn that diminishing returns are likely and cap at 3.

**Pass Schedule:**

| Pass | Focus | Goal |
|------|-------|------|
| 1 — Tighten | Cut filler, compress language, remove redundancy | Every word earns its place |
| 2 — Strengthen | Upgrade weak imagery, sharpen sensory detail, replace generic with specific | Lines that stick |
| 3 — Flow & Ear | Read-aloud test, smooth transitions, singability at target BPM | Sounds right when sung |

See [craft-reference.md](craft-reference.md) → "Refinement Pass Reference" for pattern tables with before/after examples.

**Each pass re-runs the 13-point quality check** on the revised version. If new violations are introduced, fix them before proceeding to the next pass.

**Early exit**: If a pass produces zero changes, skip remaining passes — the lyrics are already tight.

**Refinement Log**: After all passes, present a log showing what changed:

```
## Refinement Log

### Pass 1 (Tighten)
| Line | Before | After | Reason |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| V1 L3 | "He stood up and spoke the words" | "He said" | Filler phrase |
| C L2 | "completely shattered apart" | "shattered" | Redundant modifier |

### Pass 2 (Strengthen)
(no changes — early exit)
```

**Rules:**
- **Preserve voice** — refinement polishes word choice and density. Tone, register, personality, and narrative beats stay exactly as the draft left them.
- **Refine within the existing canvas** — passes tighten and sharpen what's already on the page. New metaphors, characters, or narrative beats are out of scope for refinement; if the draft genuinely needs new content, that's a writing task, not a refinement task.
- **Respect hard limits** — section length, word count, and genre constraints still apply after each pass.
- **Respect override preferences** — if the user's lyric-writing-guide.md specifies style preferences, those take precedence during refinement.

## Override Support

Check for custom lyric writing preferences:

### Loading Override
1. Call `load_override("lyric-writing-guide.md")` — returns override content if found (auto-resolves path from config)
2. If found: read and incorporate as additional context
3. If not found: use base guidelines only

### Override File Format

**`{overrides}/lyric-writing-guide.md`:**
```markdown
# Lyric Writing Guide

## Style Preferences
- Prefer first-person narrative
- Avoid religious imagery
- Use vivid sensory details
- Keep verses 4-6 lines max

## Vocabulary
- Avoid: utilize, commence, endeavor (too formal)
- Prefer: simple, direct language

## Themes
- Focus on: technology, alienation, urban decay
- Avoid: love songs, party anthems

## Custom Rules
- Never use the word "baby" in lyrics
- Avoid clichés: "heart of gold", "burning bright"
```

### How to Use Override
1. Load at invocation start
2. Use as additional context when writing lyrics
3. Apply preferences alongside base principles
4. Override preferences take precedence if conflicting

**Example:**
- Base says: "Show don't tell"
- Override says: "Prefer first-person narrative"
- Result: Show emotion through first-person actions/observations

---

## Prosody (Syllable Stress)

Prosody is matching stressed syllables to strong musical beats.

**Rules:**
- Stressed syllables land on downbeats (beats 1 and 3)
- Multi-syllable words need natural emphasis: HAP-py, not hap-PY
- High melody notes = emphasized words

**Test**: Speak the lyric. If emphasis feels wrong, rewrite it.

---

## Rhyme Techniques

See [craft-reference.md](craft-reference.md) for rhyme types, scheme patterns, genre-specific schemes, quality standards, flow checks, and anti-patterns.

## Show Don't Tell

### ACTION - What would someone DO feeling this emotion?
- ❌ "My heart is breaking"
- ✅ "She fell to her knees as he packed his bag"

### IMAGERY - Nouns that can be seen/touched
- ❌ "I felt so sad"
- ✅ "Coffee gone cold on the counter"

### SENSORY DETAIL - Engage multiple senses
- Sight, sound, smell, touch, taste, organic (body), kinesthetic (motion)

**Section balance**: Verses = sensory details. Choruses = emotional statements.

---

## Verse/Chorus Contrast

| Element | Verse | Chorus |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Lyrics | Observational, narrative | Emotional, universal |
| Energy | Building | Peak |
| Detail | Specific sensory | Abstract emotional |

### No Verse-Chorus Echo

A verse must never repeat a key phrase, image, or rhyme word that appears in the chorus it leads into. The chorus is the hook — if the verse already said it, the chorus loses its impact.

**What to check** — before finalizing any track, compare:
1. The last 2 lines of every verse/section that precedes a chorus
2. The first 2 lines of the chorus

Flag any of these overlaps:
- **Exact phrase**: Same words appear in both (e.g., "digital heart" / "digital heart")
- **Same rhyme word**: Verse ends on "start," chorus opens on "start"
- **Restated hook**: Verse paraphrases the chorus hook in different words
- **Shared imagery**: Verse uses the chorus's signature image (e.g., both say "warehouse")

**Red flags:**
- Last line of verse contains ANY phrase from the chorus first line
- A signature chorus word (the hook word) appears anywhere in the preceding verse
- The verse "gives away" the chorus before it hits

**Fix:**
1. Rewrite the verse line to use DIFFERENT imagery that SETS UP the chorus
2. The verse should create tension or expectation — the chorus resolves it
3. Complementary, not redundant: verse says "spark," chorus says "start"

**Scope:** This applies to EVERY verse-to-chorus transition in the track, not just the first one. Check all of them. Also check bridge-to-chorus transitions.

**Example:**

Bad:
> This is where the future of tech TV got its start.
> [Chorus] Five-three-five York Street — where the future got its start,

Good:
> This is where it all began, the very first spark.
> [Chorus] Five-three-five York Street — where the future got its start,

---

## Hook & Title Placement

- Title in first or last line of chorus
- Repeat title at song's beginning AND end
- Give title priority: rhythmic accent, melodic peak

---

## Line Length, Song Length & Section Limits

See [craft-reference.md](craft-reference.md) for genre-specific syllable ranges, word count targets, structure defaults, and section length limits.

## Lyric Density & Pacing

See [craft-reference.md](craft-reference.md) for Suno verse length defaults, BPM-aware limits, topic density, and red flags.

## Point of View & Tense

**POV**: Choose one and maintain it
- First (I/me) - most intimate
- Second (you) - draws listener in
- Third (he/she/they) - storyteller distance

**Tense**: Stay consistent within sections
- Present - immediate, powerful
- Past - distance, reflection

---

## Lyric Pitfalls Checklist

Before finalizing:
- [ ] Forced emphasis (stressed syllables on wrong beats)
- [ ] Inverted word order for rhyme
- [ ] Predictable rhymes (moon/June, fire/desire)
- [ ] Pronoun inconsistency
- [ ] Tense jumping without reason
- [ ] Too specific (alienating names/places)
- [ ] Too vague (abstractions without imagery)
- [ ] Twin verses (V2 = V1 reworded — V2 must advance the story, deepen emotion, or shift perspective, not just rephrase V1. Example: V1 "Streets are cold, I walk alone" → bad V2 "Roads are freezing, I'm by myself" (same idea reworded) → good V2 "Found your old coat in the closet / Still smells like smoke and home" (new detail, emotional shift))
- [ ] No hook
- [ ] Disingenuous voice
- [ ] Section too long for genre (check Section Length Limits table)
- [ ] Orphan lines (line should rhyme with a partner per genre scheme but doesn't)
- [ ] Wrong rhyme scheme for genre (e.g., AABB couplets in a folk ballad)
- [ ] Filler phrases padding lines for rhyme or quote setup
- [ ] Inconsistent syllable counts within a verse (tolerance varies by genre)
- [ ] Verse exceeds Suno line limit for genre (check genre README's Density/pacing default)
- [ ] 8-line verse at BPM under 100 (too dense for Suno — split or trim)
- [ ] Too many proper nouns in a single verse (max 3 introductions per verse)
- [ ] Density mismatch (Musical Direction says "laid back" but verses are packed)
- [ ] Verse-chorus echo (verse repeats chorus phrase, rhyme word, hook, or signature imagery)
- [ ] Invented contractions (signal'd, TV'd — Suno only handles standard pronoun/auxiliary contractions)
- [ ] Pronunciation table not enforced (word in table but standard spelling in Suno lyrics)

---

## Pronunciation

**Always use phonetic spelling** for tricky words:

| Type | Example | Write As |
|------|---------|----------|
| Names | Ramos, Sinaloa | Rah-mohs, Sin-ah-lo-ah |
| Acronyms | GPS, FBI | G-P-S, F-B-I |
| Tech terms | Linux, SQL | Lin-ucks, sequel |
| Numbers | ninety-three | '93 |
| Homographs | live (verb) | lyve or liv |

### Homograph Handling (Suno Pronunciation)

Suno renders pronunciation literally from spelling alone — context cues are invisible to the model. Every homograph in the lyrics needs an explicit user decision recorded in the Pronunciation Notes table, then applied as phonetic spelling in the Suno Lyrics Box only.

**Why this matters:** Even when a sentence makes the intended reading obvious to a human reader, Suno's TTS picks one pronunciation and locks it in. Wrong choice → wrong vocal line on every regen.

**Workflow across skills:**
```
lyric-writer (FLAGS) → pronunciation-specialist (RESOLVES) → lyric-reviewer (VERIFIES)
```

**Your role as writer — flag, batch-ask, apply:**
1. **Identify**: Flag every homograph in the lyrics during phonetic review (use the table below as a baseline; it is not exhaustive).
2. **Batch-ask**: When a track contains multiple homographs, present them in a single user message — numbered list with both pronunciation options per word — and accept all decisions in one user reply. Per-word back-and-forth balloons the conversation and breaks flow.
3. **Apply**: Replace with phonetic spelling in Suno lyric lines only. Streaming/distributor lyrics keep standard English spelling.
4. **Document**: Add each resolved homograph to the track's Pronunciation Notes table with the user's chosen reading.

The pronunciation-specialist resolves complex cases (regional accents, character voices, dialect markers). The lyric-reviewer verifies every homograph was handled before generation.

**Common homographs — every one needs an explicit user decision:**
*(Canonical homograph reference: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/pronunciation-guide.md`. Keep this table in sync.)*

| Word | Pronunciation A | Phonetic | Pronunciation B | Phonetic |
|------|----------------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| live | real-time/broadcast | lyve | reside/exist | live |
| read | present tense | reed | past tense | red |
| lead | to guide | leed | metal | led |
| wound | injury | woond | past of wind | wownd |
| close | to shut | kloze | nearby | klohs |
| bass | low sound | bayss | the fish | bas |
| tear | from crying | teer | to rip | tare |
| wind | air movement | wihnd | to turn | wynd |

**Rules:**
- Every homograph in the phonetic checklist must trace to a recorded user decision in the Pronunciation Notes table — "context clear" is not a valid resolution.
- The user is the only authority on which pronunciation is intended. Ask when in doubt; treat ambiguity as a flag, not a judgment call.
- Phonetic spellings live in the Suno Lyrics Box only. Streaming/distributor lyrics use standard English.
- Full homograph reference: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/pronunciation-guide.md`

### No Invented Contractions (Suno)

Suno only recognizes standard English contractions. Never use made-up contractions by appending 'd, 'll, etc. to nouns, brand names, or non-standard words.

**Standard (OK for Suno):** they'd, he'd, you'd, she'd, we'd, I'd, wouldn't, couldn't, shouldn't

**Invented (will break Suno):** signal'd, TV'd, network'd, podcast'd, channel'd

**Fix:** Spell it out — "signal would" not "signal'd", "TV could" not "TV'd"

**Rule:** If the base word isn't a pronoun or standard auxiliary verb, don't contract it. Suno will mispronounce or skip invented contractions.

### Pronunciation Table Enforcement (Suno)

Every entry in a track's Pronunciation Notes table MUST be applied as phonetic spelling in the Suno lyric lines. The pronunciation table is not documentation — it is a checklist of required substitutions.

**Process (before finalizing any track for Suno generation):**
1. Read the track's Pronunciation Notes table top to bottom
2. For EACH entry, search the Suno lyrics for the standard spelling
3. If found, replace with the phonetic spelling
4. If the phonetic is already applied, confirm it matches the table

**Verification format** — update the Phonetic Review Checklist:
- ❌ `"Potrero" in pronunciation table but "Potrero" in Suno lyrics` — FAIL
- ✅ `"poh-TREH-roh" in Suno lyrics matches pronunciation table` — PASS

**Rules:**
- The pronunciation table is the source of truth for Suno spelling. Every entry must appear as its phonetic form in the Suno Lyrics Box.
- Every Suno lyric line that contains a tabled word uses the phonetic spelling — every verse, every chorus repeat, every bridge.
- Phonetics belong in the Suno Lyrics Box only; streaming lyrics keep standard spelling.
- When uncertain whether a word needs phonetic treatment, ask the user — better to flag and confirm than ship a guess.

**Common failures:**
- Word added to pronunciation table during track creation but never applied to lyrics
- Phonetic applied in one verse but missed in another (chorus repeat, bridge)
- New lyric edit introduces a word that's already in the table but isn't phonetic

**Anti-pattern:**
```
WRONG:   Pronunciation Table: Potrero → poh-TREH-roh
         Suno Lyrics: "Potrero Hill, industrial..."

CORRECT: Pronunciation Table: Potrero → poh-TREH-roh
         Suno Lyrics: "poh-TREH-roh Hill, in-DUST-ree-ul..."
```

---

## Documentary Standards

For true crime/documentary tracks, see [documentary-standards.md](documentary-standards.md).

**The Five Rules:**
1. **Third-person narrator only** — render the story from outside the subject; the narrator describes, not impersonates.
2. **Quote only what's in the source record** — verbatim, with citation. Anything in quotation marks must be traceable to testimony, transcript, or recorded statement.
3. **Internal states require testimony** — render thoughts, feelings, or motivations only when a source (interview, statement, court record) supports them.
4. **Actions must be in the record** — render only events that appear in the source material; no invented beats, no implied scenes.
5. **Confine factual claims to what sources affirm** — absence of evidence is not a claim. "Nobody saw" needs a source asserting that, not a gap in the record.

---

## Cross-Track Referencing (Concept Albums)

### When to Activate

Activate when **all** of these are true:
- Album type is **Narrative**, **Thematic**, **Character Study**, **Documentary**, or **OST**
- Current track number is **> 1** (track 01 establishes — it doesn't reference)

### Process

1. **Read album context**: Album README → Concept, Structure, Motifs & Threads sections
2. **Read previous tracks**: Tracks 1 through N-1 (lyrics, concept, cross-references)
3. **Identify 1–3 callback opportunities**: Look for lyrical images, phrases, character moments, or thematic threads that can be echoed, inverted, or resolved
4. **Draft with references woven in**: Integrate naturally — the reference should feel like part of this track, not a footnote
5. **Document**: Update the track's Cross-References section AND the album's Motifs & Threads table

### Reference Density by Album Position

| Position | Target References | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Track 01 | 0 | Establishes motifs — nothing to reference yet |
| Tracks 02–04 (early) | 1–2 | Light callbacks; building the vocabulary |
| Tracks 05–08 (mid) | 2–3 | Weaving threads together; peak density |
| Final 1–2 tracks | 2–4 | Resolving threads; bookend with track 01 |

### Reference Types

| Type | What It Does | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Callback** | Echoes an earlier lyric or image in new context | Track 01: "the door was red" → Track 07: "red doors don't open twice" |
| **Motif** | Recurring thematic element that gains meaning | "static" appearing across tracks as technology fails |
| **Character thread** | Same character reappears or is referenced | Track 03 introduces a witness; Track 08 shows their testimony |
| **Contrast/Inversion** | Deliberately flips an earlier idea | Track 02: "the signal's strong" → Track 09: "nothing but noise" |
| **Resolution** | Resolves tension or question from earlier track | Track 04 asks "who called the cops?" → Track 11 answers it |

### Quality Rules

- **Subtle over heavy** — a single echoed image beats a quoted line. The listener should feel the connection, not be hit with it.
- **New context required** — a callback must mean something different in its new location. Same phrase, same meaning = lazy repetition, not a callback.
- **Don't force it** — if no natural callback opportunity exists, write the track without one. Forced references hurt worse than no references.
- **Bookend rule** — the final track should echo at least one element from track 01, creating a sense of closure.
- **Track must stand alone first** — every track must work as a complete song without the callbacks. References are a bonus layer, not a crutch.

### Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Quoting whole lines from earlier tracks verbatim (lazy — transform the reference)
- ❌ Forward references to tracks not yet written (breaks the writing flow; only backward references)
- ❌ Referencing every previous track in a single song (overwhelming — pick 1–3 strongest connections)
- ❌ Making the callback the hook or chorus (callbacks belong in verses/bridges — the hook should stand alone)
- ❌ Explaining the reference in the lyrics ("just like track three said…")

## Working On a Track

**When asked to work on a track**, immediately scan for:
- Weak/awkward lines, forced rhymes
- Prosody problems
- POV or tense inconsistencies
- Twin verses
- Missing hook or buried title
- Factual inaccuracies
- Pronunciation risks

Report all issues with proposed fixes, then proceed.

---

## Workflow

As the lyric writer, you:
1. **Receive track concept** - From album-conceptualizer or user
1.5. **Load album context** - (Concept albums only) Read album README and previous tracks for cross-referencing opportunities. See "Cross-Track Referencing" section.
2. **Draft initial lyrics** - Apply core principles, weaving in callbacks where appropriate
3. **Run quality checks** - Verify rhyme, POV, tense, structure (13-point check)
3.5. **Run refinement passes** - Default: 1 pass. Tighten, strengthen, polish. See "Iterative Refinement Passes" section.
4. **Scan for pronunciation risks** - Check proper nouns, homographs
5. **Apply phonetic fixes** - Replace risky words
6. **Verify against sources** - If documentary track
7. **Finalize lyrics** - Update Lyrics Box, Streaming Lyrics, Cross-References, and Motifs & Threads table (concept albums)
8. **Hand off to Suno engineer** - Automatically invoke `/bitwize-music:suno-engineer` with the track file path to populate the Style Box and Suno Inputs section. Do not wait for the user to request this — it is the natural next step after lyrics are finalized.

---

## Remember

1. **Load override first** - Call `load_override("lyric-writing-guide.md")` at invocation. **Why:** the user's vocabulary preferences, theme avoidances, and custom rules outrank base craft guidelines and must be in context before the first line is drafted.
2. **Watch your rhymes** - No self-rhymes, no lazy patterns
3. **Prosody matters** - Stressed syllables on strong beats
4. **Show don't tell** - Action, imagery, sensory detail
5. **V2 ≠ V1** - Second verse must develop, not twin
6. **Pronunciation is critical** - Phonetic spelling for risky words
7. **Documentary = legal risk** - Follow the five rules
8. **Apply user preferences** - Override guide preferences take precedence
9. **Concept albums connect** - Read previous tracks, weave 1–3 callbacks, update Motifs & Threads table
10. **Refine before presenting** - Run refinement passes (default: 1), show Refinement Log with before→after for each change

**Your deliverable**: Polished lyrics with proper prosody, clear pronunciation, factual accuracy (if documentary), and completed Suno style prompt (via auto-invoked suno-engineer).
