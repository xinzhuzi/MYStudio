# Image models (API / closed)

Part of the kit's per-model prompting reference. The routing table and the auto-pull rule live in
[`MODELS.md`](../MODELS.md); this file holds the 13 entries for this family.


### Ideogram (2.x to 4.0, plus P-Image)
- **Nodes available (ComfyUI v0.29.2):** **`IdeogramV3`**, **`IdeogramV4`** and, new in v0.29.2, **`IdeogramPImage`**. The old **`IdeogramV1` and `IdeogramV2` nodes were REMOVED in v0.28.0** (Comfy-Org PR #14712), so an older graph that loads them will fail to resolve the node; rebuild it on V3 / V4. Confirmed from `comfy_api_nodes/nodes_ideogram.py` on master (the extension registers exactly those three) plus the v0.28.0 and v0.29.2 release notes.
- **Prompt style:** natural-language sentences (no tags, no `--ar`/`::` flags); typography specialist.
- **Structure:** describe as to a person; important elements and text early; exact text in quotes (under ~25 chars), describe font style/position/color, don't name fonts.
- **Strengths:** quoted-text rendering, posters/logos/signage; `DESIGN` style for typography, `REALISTIC` for photos.
- **Avoid:** long text strings, burying text mid-prompt, naming fonts. Negative prompts ARE supported (`negative_prompt`; positive takes precedence).
- **Settings (API):** `style_type`, `rendering_speed` (TURBO/DEFAULT/QUALITY), `magic_prompt`, aspect ratios, seed, up to 4 images/call, character & style refs.
- **Structured / JSON prompting (Ideogram 4) - two real paths:**
  - **Base node:** **`IdeogramV4`** ("Ideogram V4") takes a plain multiline `prompt` (+ a `resolution` combo, `rendering_speed` = `DEFAULT` / `TURBO` / `QUALITY`, and `seed`) -> `SaveImage` (confirmed from `comfy_api_nodes/nodes_ideogram.py`). The official `api_ideogram_v4_t2i` template expands a short idea into a longer caption with a **`GeminiNode`** "magic prompt" that feeds `IdeogramV4`.
  - **Spatial structured-control path (new core nodes, confirmed from `comfy_extras/nodes_bounding_boxes.py` + `nodes_json_prompt.py` + `nodes_ideogram4.py`):** **`CreateBoundingBoxes`** ("Create Bounding Boxes", category `utilities`) is a visual region editor (drag boxes, grid-snap, colour-pick) with outputs `preview` (IMAGE), `bboxes` (BOUNDING_BOX), `elements` (ARRAY). Wire `elements` into **`BuildJsonPromptIdeogram`** ("Build JSON Prompt (Ideogram)", category `text`) along with `high_level_description`, `background`, `style` (`none` / `photo` / `art_style`), `aesthetics`, `lighting`, `medium`, and a `color_palette` (COLORS, up to 16 hex); it outputs a `prompt` (DICT) caption (`high_level_description` / `style_description` / `compositional_deconstruction`) for Ideogram 4. **`Ideogram4Scheduler`** ("Ideogram 4 Scheduler") is the paired scheduler. Use this to PLACE elements spatially instead of hoping prose lands the layout. These nodes are experimental and very new (the `CreateBoundingBoxes` widget landed in frontend v1.48.2, 2026-07-11), so no official template ships them yet.
- **P-Image (new in core v0.29.2, PR 15154) - the fast tier that still does typography.** Node **`IdeogramPImage`** ("Ideogram P-Image", category `partner/image/Ideogram`), confirmed from `comfy_api_nodes/nodes_ideogram.py` on master.
  - **Widgets:** `prompt` (multiline), `quality` (`VERY_LOW` / `LOW` / `MEDIUM` / `HIGH`, default `MEDIUM`), `resolution` (`1K` / `2K`, default `1K`), `aspect_ratio` (the V3 ratio list, default `1:1`), `prompt_upsampling` (`AUTO` / `ON` / `OFF`, default `AUTO`), `seed`.
  - **Two outputs:** `IMAGE` and **`final_prompt` (STRING)** - the caption the image was actually generated from. This is the reproducibility handle: with upsampling ON or AUTO the rewrite varies per run, so to reproduce a result feed `final_prompt` back in with `prompt_upsampling` = `OFF` and the same seed. Wire `final_prompt` to `PreviewAny` to read it.
  - **Build the graph (official `api_ideogram_p_image_t2i` template):** `CreateBoundingBoxes` -> `BuildJsonPromptIdeogram` -> `IdeogramPImage.prompt`, then `IdeogramPImage.IMAGE` -> `SaveImageAdvanced` and `final_prompt` -> `PreviewAny`. That is the same structured-caption path as Ideogram 4 above, so the spatial layout tooling carries straight over. Plain prose into `prompt` also works.
  - **Rules that matter:** the node's own tooltips say difficult text renders poorly **below `MEDIUM`**, and to prefer **`HIGH` + `2K`** for crisp typography; set `prompt_upsampling` = `OFF` whenever you supply your own JSON caption or exact wording, otherwise the rewrite overwrites it. Resolution is a size CLASS, not pixels: 16:9 gives 1280x720 at 1K and 2560x1440 at 2K. A blocked generation raises a content-safety error rather than returning an image.

### Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image)
- **Prompt style:** natural-language, rich descriptive paragraphs (describe the scene, don't list keywords).
- **Structure:** prose covering subject, spatial relationships, lighting/mood, woven-in camera language; exact text in quotes; label each reference by role ("Image 1 is the product").
- **Strengths:** internal reasoning before render, multilingual text + in-image translation, character consistency, reference blending, Google Search grounding (add "using current data"), world-knowledge physics. Up to 11 refs.
- **Avoid:** keyword lists, bracket templates, telegraphic language, vague praise. Negatives not used, phrase positively ("an empty street", not "no cars").
- **Source:** ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation.

### Nano Banana 2 (Gemini 3.1 Flash Image)
- **Prompt style:** natural-language descriptive prose (same as Pro), speed-optimized (<~20s).
- **Structure:** six elements - subject, composition/camera, action, aspect ratio (state when non-standard), lighting (photographic terms), style; exact text in quotes; label refs; request resolution above default 1K.
- **Strengths:** fast iteration, extended ratios (1:4, 4:1, 1:8, 8:1), tiers 0.5K/1K/2K/4K, web+image Search grounding, up to 14 refs, 360-degree character sheets.
- **Avoid:** keyword dumps, bracket templates, negative phrasing, temperature below 1.0 (loops). Small CJK text and data-viz error-prone; knowledge cutoff Jan 2025 (use grounding).
- **Source:** ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation.

### Nano Banana 2 Lite (Gemini Flash Image, fast tier)
- **Prompt style:** the same descriptive prose as Nano Banana 2, at a lower quality ceiling; built for volume, not the last 5% of fidelity.
- **Strengths:** the fastest / cheapest Nano Banana tier. Vendor claims from the ComfyUI launch post (treat as marketing): ~4 s per image, ~$0.034 per 1K images. Aimed at high-volume iteration and batch variations (ad-asset batches, 50 concept variants before the brief changes).
- **Run it:** official Comfy partner API nodes / templates `api_nano_banana_2_lite_t2i` (text-to-image) and `api_nano_banana_2_lite_image_edit` (edit), both confirmed in the Comfy-Org/workflow_templates index (a sibling `api_google_nano_banana2_image_edit` also ships). Cloud / paid (Comfy Cloud or a Gemini API key), NOT a local model.
- **Source:** ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation ; Comfy-Org/workflow_templates (`api_nano_banana_2_lite_*`).

### Seedream 4.0 / 4.5 (ByteDance)
- **Prompt style:** structured (technical specifications, direct over narrative - the exception among modern models).
- **Structure:** explicit identity-lock descriptors (face, hair, build, clothing) for series; state what's consistent vs variable; exact text in quotes; 50-100 words (range 30-300; cap ~600 EN words / 300 CN chars).
- **Strengths:** up to 15-image sequential batch with identity locking, up to 14 refs, facial-landmark consistency, sharp small-text/logo typography.
- **Avoid:** keyword dumps, flowery language, missing identity-lock descriptors. Describe positively (no explicit negative guidance).
- **Source:** volcengine.com/docs (BytePlus/Volcengine Seedream) ; node template `seedream.md`.

### Seedream 5.0 Lite (ByteDance)
- **Prompt style:** natural-language sentences REPLACE keyword lists; relationship-first; CoT reasoning model.
- **Structure:** `[subject + key trait] [action/pose] [environment with spatial relationship] [optional one-phrase style anchor]`; state object relationships; for series state count + consistency; text in double quotes; refs as Figure 1, 2.
- **Strengths:** coherent from short/abstract prompts, web search, stronger identity lock than 4.x, 2560x1440 to 3072x3072 (`auto_2K`/`auto_3K`).
- **Avoid:** CRITICAL - quality boosters ("masterpiece", "8K", "best quality") HARM output (distract the CoT pipeline); no `(word:1.3)` weights; negatives NOT supported; no guidance-scale param.
- **Source:** volcengine.com/docs (Seedream 5.0 Lite) ; node template `seedream_5_lite.md`.

### Seedream 5.0 Pro (ByteDance)
- **Prompt style:** same natural-language, CoT-reasoning family as 5.0 Lite (relationship-first sentences, NOT keyword lists); state object relationships and, for a series, count + consistency; exact text in double quotes; label refs as Figure 1, 2.
- **Strengths:** ByteDance's latest image model - **multi-modal in ONE node** (text-to-image, precise image editing, multi-image inputs); strong **character + product consistency** (portrait identity / lighting / realism held across style changes and edits); **region-precise editing** (edit a target area, leave lighting / depth / texture elsewhere untouched); **structured layouts** (infographics, flowcharts, mixed text+image with legible small text). Up to ~2048x2048.
- **Avoid:** quality boosters ("masterpiece", "8K", "best quality") HARM output (they distract the CoT pipeline); no `(word:1.3)` weights; negatives NOT supported; no guidance-scale param.
- **Thinking toggle (ComfyUI v0.28.0):** the Seedream node gained a widget to **disable thinking** (Comfy-Org PR #14853). Leave it ON for the CoT behaviour this recipe assumes (relationship reasoning, layout planning); turn it OFF for a faster, more literal pass when the prompt is already explicit and you do not want the model re-planning the composition.
- **Build the graph (confirmed from the official templates):** ONE node **`ByteDanceSeedreamNodeV2`** -> **`SaveImageAdvanced`** (its `IMAGE` out -> `SaveImageAdvanced.images`). Node widgets = prompt, `model` = `seedream 5.0 pro`, a **size-preset combo** (e.g. `(1K) 1024x1024 (1:1)`) + width / height (up to 2048), seed + control_after_generate (leave the remaining toggles at their template defaults).
  - **t2i** - just the node, its `model.images.image_1` input left unconnected.
  - **edit / multi-image** - **`LoadImage`** -> `model.images.image_1` (add `image_2`, `image_3`... for more refs) -> node -> `SaveImageAdvanced`. To constrain the edit to a drawn region, route `LoadImage` through a **`Painter`** node first (draw marks; its `IMAGE` out feeds `image_1`) - the official edit template does exactly this.
  - Templates `api_bytedance_seedream_5_0_pro_{t2i,image_edit}.json`. API / paid (Comfy Cloud or a BytePlus key).
- **Layer separation (new in core v0.31.0): one image in, an editable layered document out.** Node
  **`ByteDanceSeedreamLayerSeparationNode`** ("ByteDance Seedream 5.0 Pro Layer Separation", category
  `partner/image/ByteDance`) decomposes an image into a background plate plus **up to 16 repositionable
  transparent layers**, each with stacking order, bounding box, name and description. Confirmed by reading
  `comfy_api_nodes/nodes_bytedance.py` on master and the template `api_bytedance_seedream_5_0_layer_separation.json`.
  - **Inputs:** `image` (exactly one, at least 512x512, aspect between 1:16 and 16:1; anything over about 4 MP is
    downscaled before upload); `prompt` (**leave empty to auto-detect and separate all major elements**, or name
    the elements in natural language, or target exact regions with `<bbox>left top right bottom</bbox>` tags in
    **per-mille coordinates, 0 to 1000**); `size` (auto / 1K / 1.5K / 2K, auto follows the input clamped to
    1K-2K); `seed`; `prompt_optimization` (standard / fast, advanced); `watermark`; and **`crop_layers`**, which
    changes the SHAPE of the outputs: off = "full canvas" (each layer on a base-sized canvas at its bbox
    position, recomposable directly with `ImageCompositeMasked`), on = "minimal size" (each layer cropped to its
    bbox and padded to the largest layer, much smaller tensors, placement rebuilt from `bboxes`).
  - **Outputs, in slot order:** `base_image` (IMAGE), `base_mask` (MASK, currently always fully opaque),
    `layers` (IMAGE batch, bottom to top), `masks` (MASK batch, index-aligned with `layers`), `bboxes`
    (BOUNDING_BOX, one per layer, carrying `name`, `desc`, `z_index`, `native_size`, `content_rect`, `flags`),
    `layer_stack` (LAYERS).
  - **Two recompose paths, and the shipped template wires BOTH.** Short path: `layer_stack` -> `ImageCompositor`
    ("Create Layered Image") and you are done. Rebuild path: `base_image` + `layers` -> `BatchImagesNode`,
    `base_mask` + `masks` -> `BatchMasksNode`, then those two plus `bboxes` -> `LayersFromBoundingBoxes`
    ("Layers From Bounding Boxes") -> a second `ImageCompositor`. `BatchImagesNode` also feeds
    `SaveImageAdvanced` so you can write the flat layer sheet out. `ImageCompositor`, `AddLayer` and
    `LayersFromBoundingBoxes` all live in `comfy_extras/nodes_compositor.py`, new in the same release.
  - **Mask convention gotcha:** `masks` follows the `LoadImage` convention where **1 means transparent**. For
    `ImageCompositeMasked`-style compositing, put an `InvertMask` in front.
  - **Price** (from the node's own badge expression): **$0.032 per image** at 1K or 1.5K, and a $0.032 to $0.064
    range when `size` is anything else (auto or 2K).
  - The template's Note says to switch to Nodes 2.0 and click `Open Compositor` to edit the stack interactively.

### Qwen Image 3.0 Pro (Alibaba, API) - CORRECTED 2026-08-15: the partner nodes now EXIST
Two templates landed on 2026-08-06 (`api_qwen3_t2i`, `api_qwen3_image_edit`) and they are **gated to the cloud
distribution**: both carry `"includeOnDistributions": ["cloud"]` in the library index, so the TEMPLATES may
not show up in a local install even now. The NODES themselves shipped in core v0.32.0; see the correction
directly below, which reverses what this entry said on 2026-08-09.

- **This entry said the opposite a week ago, and the earlier claim is now false.** On 2026-08-09 both node
  classes really were absent from `comfy_api_nodes/` on master. They landed in core **v0.32.0** (PR 15327,
  "[Partner Nodes] feat(Qwen): add Qwen-Image 3.0 Pro"), and `comfy_api_nodes/nodes_qwen.py` on master now
  registers **`QwenImageTextToImageApi`** ("Qwen Image 3 Text to Image") and **`QwenImageEditApi`**
  ("Qwen Image 3 Edit"). Both were read on 2026-08-15. Update ComfyUI to v0.32.0 or later and they appear.
  The templates may still be cloud-gated in the library index; the NODES are not.
- **What the nodes actually take (read from the file):** a `model` DynamicCombo over
  `QWEN_IMAGE_MODELS = ["qwen-image-3.0-pro", "qwen-image-3.0"]`, so the Pro and the standard tier share one
  node. Both nodes carry `prompt` and **`negative_prompt`** (multiline), `n` (image count, default 1), `seed`
  (default 42), **`prompt_extend`** (BOOLEAN, default **True**, "enhance the prompt with AI assistance") and
  **`watermark`** (BOOLEAN, default **False**). `QwenImageEditApi` adds an **Autogrow `images`** input for
  reference images plus a second DynamicCombo. Turn `prompt_extend` OFF when you have written the prompt
  precisely, exactly as with Ideogram's `prompt_upsampling`.
- Do not confuse them with
  `TextEncodeQwenImageEdit` / `TextEncodeQwenImageEditPlus` in `comfy_extras/nodes_qwen.py`, which belong to the
  **local, open-weight** Qwen-Image-Edit and are a different thing entirely.
- **The graph:** t2i is `ResolutionSelector` (core, `nodes_resolution.py`:
  `aspect_ratio` combo, `megapixels` float, `multiple` int, outputs width and height INT) -> `QwenImageTextToImageApi`
  width / height -> `SaveImage`. Edit is `LoadImage` -> `QwenImageEditApi` -> `SaveImage`. The `model` widget
  value in both is the string `qwen-image-3.0-pro`.
- **Settings from the templates:** `ResolutionSelector` ships `1:1 (Square)`, megapixels 1, multiple 8, and the
  template's own note says **megapixels can go up to 6.2**, or you delete the selector and set width / height by
  hand.
- **What the model is for** (official template descriptions): prompts up to **4.5k tokens**, complex single-pass
  layouts (posters, infographics, storyboards, newspapers, menus, exam papers), **crisp 10 px text**, native
  rendering in **12 languages**, 100-plus art styles, and 1 to 3 optional reference images for fusion editing.
  So: write long, structured, layout-describing prompts, not keyword lists.
- **Confirmed vs inferred:** the cloud gating of the templates and the graph shape are confirmed from the
  library index and the template JSONs; the node names, their model list and their widgets are confirmed from
  `comfy_api_nodes/nodes_qwen.py` on master, read 2026-08-15. Everything under "what the model is for" is the
  vendor's own template copy, not measured.
- **Source:** Comfy-Org/workflow_templates `templates/index.json` + `api_qwen3_t2i.json` / `api_qwen3_image_edit.json` ; `comfy_extras/nodes_resolution.py` on master. Read 2026-08-09.

### Recraft (V3, and V4 / V4.1)
- **Prompt style:** natural-language, specific over vague; long-text + vector design specialist.
- **Structure:** "A `<style>` of `<main content>`. `<detailed description>`. `<background>`. `<style description>`." general -> specific; exact text in quotes.
- **Strengths:** long multi-word text with exact positioning/sizing; `style` param (`realistic_image`, `digital_illustration`, `vector_illustration`, `icon`) + 100+ presets + custom style refs; true scalable vector/SVG.
- **Avoid:** negative phrasing confuses it (just omit unwanted elements, no negative field); ambiguous nouns; vague plurals.
- **Two generations of nodes ship side by side** (confirmed from the `RecraftExtension` node list in `comfy_api_nodes/nodes_recraft.py` on master). V3 keeps the style/substyle system: `RecraftTextToImageNode`, `RecraftImageToImageNode`, `RecraftImageInpaintingNode`, `RecraftTextToVectorNode`, plus the utilities (`RecraftVectorizeImageNode`, `RecraftRemoveBackgroundNode`, `RecraftReplaceBackgroundNode`, `RecraftCrispUpscaleNode`, `RecraftCreativeUpscaleNode`) and the style helpers (`RecraftStyleV3*`, `RecraftCreateStyleNode`, `RecraftControlsNode`, `RecraftColorRGBNode`). **V4 / V4.1 add exactly two nodes: `RecraftV4TextToImageNode` and `RecraftV4TextToVectorNode`** - there is no V4 image-to-image or inpainting node, so an edit still routes through the V3 nodes.
- **V4.1, new in core v0.29.0 (PR 15105):** both V4 nodes take a **`model` DynamicCombo** whose options are `recraftv4_1`, `recraftv4_1_utility`, `recraftv4_1_pro`, `recraftv4_1_utility_pro`, `recraftv4`, `recraftv4_pro` (the vector node appends `_vector` to the four V4.1 names and keeps `recraftv4` / `recraftv4_pro`). Picking an option swaps the `size` list with it: the standard tiers offer 14 sizes with `1024x1024` as the default (the widest is `1536x768`), and each `_pro` tier offers the same 14 shapes at exactly double the dimensions, default `2048x2048`, widest `3072x1536`.
- **`negative_prompt` on the V4 nodes is a dead input.** Its own tooltip says so ("This input is ignored: negative prompt is not supported by Recraft V4 and V4.1 models") and `execute()` never reads it. Prompt cap is **10,000 characters**, `n` is 1 to 6 images per call, and the `seed` widget only decides whether the node re-runs - results are nondeterministic regardless.
- **Build the graph (official `api_recraft_v4_1_t2i` / `api_recraft_v4_1_text_to_vector` templates):** `RecraftV4TextToImageNode` -> `SaveImage`, or `RecraftV4TextToVectorNode` -> `SaveSVGNode` (the vector node returns SVG, not IMAGE, so a plain `SaveImage` will not accept it). For colour control, chain **`RecraftColorRGB` -> `RecraftControls`** and feed `RecraftControls` into the optional `recraft_controls` input; multiple `RecraftColorRGB` nodes chain together to pass a palette.
- **Source:** recraft.ai/docs (prompting + styles) ; recraft.ai/api ; `comfy_api_nodes/nodes_recraft.py` + `comfy_api_nodes/apis/recraft.py` on master ; Comfy-Org/ComfyUI PR 15105 (v0.29.0) ; templates `api_recraft_v4_1_t2i.json`, `api_recraft_v4_1_text_to_vector.json`.

### GPT-Image (gpt-image-2, OpenAI)
- **Prompt style:** structured natural-language ("structure beats length"), a labeled five-slot brief.
- **Structure:** Scene -> Subject -> Important Details (lighting, camera, materials, exact text in quotes) -> Use Case -> Constraints (don'ts/preservation); include literal "photorealistic"; spell unusual names letter-by-letter + "render text verbatim".
- **Strengths:** accurate dense/multi-font text, identity consistency, any size, up to 10 refs; `low` quality is production-grade.
- **Avoid:** vague praise, generic style tags, one giant rewrite, negative subject phrasing. No negative field, state avoidances in Constraints.
- **Settings (API):** `quality` (low/medium/high/auto), edges multiple of 16, max edge 3840px, <=3:1, reliable up to 2560x1440; `background`, `output_format`.
- **Source:** platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation.

### Grok Image (Grok Imagine Image, xAI)
- **Prompt style:** natural-language scene description, six-part formula.
- **Structure:** Subject -> Style -> Mood -> Lighting -> Camera/Framing -> Finishing; subject in the first words; 60-80 words (cut past 120); one style; in-image text ALL CAPS + quotes, 1-3 words.
- **Strengths:** behavior-based light, concrete camera/lens, named aesthetics; `-quality` tier adds i2i (1-3 refs) and better non-English text.
- **Avoid:** negatives IGNORED (rephrase positive); keyword stacking; mixed styles; buried subject.
- **Grok Imagine Image 2.0 (new 2026-08, templates `api_grok_imagine_image_2_t2i.json` and
  `..._image_edit.json`).** `grok-imagine-image-2.0` is now the first option in the model combo, above
  `grok-imagine-image-quality`, `grok-imagine-image-pro` and the base `grok-imagine-image`.
- **Build it (two nodes, both `category="partner/image/Grok"`, read from `comfy_api_nodes/nodes_grok.py`):**
  - **Text to image: `GrokImageNode`** ("Grok Image") -> IMAGE -> `SaveImageAdvanced` (template ships `png`,
    `8-bit`, `sRGB`). Widgets: `model`, `prompt`, `aspect_ratio`, `number_of_images` (1 to 10), `seed`,
    `resolution` (`1K` / `2K`), `quality` (`medium` / `low`). **`quality` is honoured only by
    `grok-imagine-image-2.0`** (the node's own tooltip). Thirteen aspect ratios, including the phone-native
    `9:19.5`, `19.5:9`, `9:20`, `20:9` that the other options in this file do not offer.
  - **Editing: `GrokImageEditNodeV2`** ("Grok Image Edit"). `LoadImage` -> its `images` input, which is an
    **Autogrow**: connect the first and a second slot appears. Feed one image per reference. Template wires
    two `LoadImage` nodes (a character reference and a product reference) and the prompt addresses them in
    order as "the first reference image" / "the second reference image". Output -> `SaveImage`.
  - **Use V2, not `GrokImageEditNode`.** The older class carries `is_deprecated=True` on master. Both share
    the display name "Grok Image Edit", so the node picker shows two identical-looking entries.
- **The edit node's widgets MOVE with the model (DynamicCombo), and the per-tier limits differ:**
  `grok-imagine-image-2.0` and `grok-imagine-image-quality` and the base model take up to **3 reference
  images**; `grok-imagine-image-pro` takes **1**. `quality` appears only under 2.0. `aspect_ratio` is absent
  under `pro`, and under `quality` / base it is **only allowed when multiple images are connected** (its own
  tooltip); under 2.0 it is unconditional.
- **Price, per image, read off the nodes' `PriceBadge` expressions (multiply by `number_of_images`):**
  2.0 at `low` quality `$0.04` (1K) / `$0.06` (2K); 2.0 at `medium` `$0.06` (1K) / `$0.08` (2K);
  `-quality` `$0.05` (1K) / `$0.07` (2K); `-pro` `$0.07`; base `$0.02`. **Editing adds an input charge** on
  top: `$0.01` per reference image for 2.0 and `-quality`, `$0.002` for the others, which is why the edit
  node shows a RANGE (one to three references) for everything except `pro`, where it shows a single figure.
- **ComfyUI (partner node):** the Grok Image node exposes a `resolution` combo of **`1K` / `2K`** (confirmed from `comfy_api_nodes/nodes_grok.py`), plus an `aspect_ratio` combo.
- **Source:** docs.x.ai/docs/guides/image-generations ; `comfy_api_nodes/nodes_grok.py` on master
  (`GrokImageNode`, `GrokImageEditNodeV2`, `GrokImageEditNode`, `_grok_image_edit_model_inputs`,
  `_GROK_IMAGE_QUALITY_OPTIONS`) ; official templates `api_grok_imagine_image_2_t2i.json` and
  `api_grok_imagine_image_2_image_edit.json`. Read 2026-08-15.

### Reve (DEPRECATED in core v0.31.0, do not build new graphs on it)
- **Status, 2026-08-09:** all three nodes carry `is_deprecated=True` in `comfy_api_nodes/nodes_reve.py` on
  master (`ReveImageCreateNode`, `ReveImageEditNode`, `ReveImageRemixNode`), landed by PR 15331 in core
  **v0.31.0**, and the four `api_reve_image_*` templates were deleted from the official library in the same
  week. `Reve` also disappeared from the library's model list. Existing graphs still load; nothing new should
  target it. Everything below is kept for reading old workflows.
- **Prompt style:** natural-language, descriptive/conversational; high prompt adherence so be concrete and complete.
- **Avoid:** negative prompts NOT supported (single `prompt` param); no documented weighting syntax (don't rely on `(red:1.3)`).
- **Settings (API):** single `prompt`; aspect ratios 16:9/9:16/3:2(def)/2:3/4:3/3:4/1:1; 4K output (Reve 2.x); edit-image endpoint.
- **Source:** app.reve.com ; docs.aimlapi.com/api-references/image-models/reve. (Official prompt-engineering page is thin.)

### Kandinsky (3.x, Sber / FusionBrain)
- **Prompt style:** natural-language; built-in beautifier LLM expands plain prompts, so describe simply.
- **Structure:** subject + setting + style in natural language; select a `style` preset; pass excluded elements via the negative field.
- **Strengths:** built-in prompt enhancement, style presets, inpainting/i2i, fully open checkpoints.
- **Avoid:** over-long prompts. Negative prompts ARE supported (dedicated field).
- **Settings (FusionBrain API):** `query` + negative field, `style`, 1024x1024 default, sizes multiples of 64.
