# Audio models

Part of the kit's per-model prompting reference. The routing table and the auto-pull rule live in
[`MODELS.md`](../MODELS.md); this file holds the 6 entries for this family.


### Stable Audio (Stability)
- **Prompt style:** genre + mood + instruments + BPM/tempo, short English phrase ("128 BPM tech house drum loop"). No lyrics, no realistic vocals.
- **Structure:** concise tag-like sound description, then set `seconds_total` (and optional `seconds_start`).
- **Strengths:** SFX, foley, ambiences, drum/instrument loops; precise BPM and instrument naming.
- **Avoid:** vocals/singing, full songs, non-English prompts.
- **Settings:** 44.1kHz stereo; max ~47s (default 47.6s via EmptyLatentAudio); steps in KSampler.
- **Download / license:** GATED on HF, accept the license + use a token to download (requires an HF account + license-agreement form at huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-audio-open-1.0 before the weights are accessible). License is NON-COMMERCIAL only (stable-audio-community); commercial use requires a separate license from stability.ai/license.

### ACE-Step
- **Prompt style:** two fields. Tags = comma-separated genres/scenes/instruments/vocals/tempo ("electronic, pop, female voice, 110 bpm, melodic"). Lyrics = `[verse]`, `[chorus]`, `[bridge]`, `[outro]`; optional leading language code `[en]`/`[zh]` (19 languages).
- **Structure:** tags describe the sound; lyrics drive sung content and sections.
- **Strengths:** mainstream styles, lyric alignment, fast (~4 min audio in ~20s on A100), lyric editing/remix.
- **Avoid:** less-common languages underperform; lyric edits in small segments; copyright risk.
- **Settings:** duration in EmptyAceStepLatentAudio (-1 random); steps 27 or 60; `denoise` for similarity; vocal prominence via LatentOperationTonemapReinhard `multiplier`.

### ElevenLabs (API via ComfyUI nodes)
- **Prompt style:** TTS = plain text (voice/emotion via parameters). SFX = specific natural-language description (material, size, environment, distance, temporal arc, acoustic space); onomatopoeia helps.
- **Strengths:** natural multilingual voices, instant cloning, precise SFX; node supports `eleven_multilingual_v2` and `eleven_v3`.
- **Avoid:** over-long SFX prompts; expecting prompt words to control tone (use parameters).
- **Settings (built-in TTS node):** `stability` (def 0.5), `similarity_boost` (def 0.75), `style` (def 0.0), `speed` (def 1.0), `use_speaker_boost`. Text-to-Effect: `duration` 0.5-30s, `prompt_influence` 0-1 (def 0.3).

### ChatterBox (Resemble AI)
- **Prompt style:** literal text to speak (expressiveness via parameters, not words); voice cloning uses a 10s+ reference clip (match language to avoid accent transfer).
- **Strengths:** zero-shot cloning, emotion intensity dial, multilingual (23+ in V3), fast.
- **Avoid:** high `exaggeration` speeds up speech (lower `cfg_weight` to compensate); language mismatch causes accent bleed.
- **Settings:** defaults `exaggeration=0.5`, `cfg_weight=0.5`; dramatic `exaggeration` 0.7+ with `cfg_weight` ~0.3.
- **ComfyUI build:** the cited repo is the Python library; for ComfyUI install `filliptm/ComfyUI_Fill-ChatterBox` (ComfyUI Manager), whose TTS node takes `text` + `reference_audio` + `exaggeration` + `cfg_weight` -> AUDIO.

### MiniMax Music 3 (open weights, native in core v0.33.1, day-0 2026-08-13)
Full songs with vocals, not loops or stems: one pass gives intro, verses, chorus and outro with a stable
arrangement. The first entry in this file that is both open-weight and song-length.
- **Files (from the template's Model Links note):** `diffusion_models/minimax_music3_dit_fp16.safetensors`
  (or `minimax_music3_dit_int8_convrot.safetensors` for low VRAM),
  `text_encoders/minimax_music3_text_encoder_pruned_int8_convrot.safetensors`,
  `vae/minimax_music3_dav.safetensors`. All under `Comfy-Org/MiniMax-Music-3` on HuggingFace.
- **Build the graph (parsed from `audio_minimax_music_3.json`, subgraph "Text to Music (MiniMax Music 3)"):**
  - `UNETLoader` -> MODEL. `CLIPLoader` with **type `minimax`** -> CLIP. `VAELoader` -> VAE.
  - `CLIPLoader` -> **`MiniMaxMusic3TextEncode`** (`clip`, `caption`, `lyrics`, `seed`, `max_duration`,
    `cfg_scale`, `top_k`). It has TWO outputs: CONDITIONING and a FLOAT **`seconds`**.
  - CONDITIONING -> `KSampler.positive`, and the SAME conditioning -> `ConditioningZeroOut` ->
    `KSampler.negative`. There is no second text encode for the negative.
  - **`seconds` -> `EmptyMiniMaxMusic3LatentAudio.seconds`** -> `KSampler.latent_image`. This link is the part
    a hand-built copy gets wrong: the latent length is decided by the ENCODER, because the autoregressive
    stage can end the song early. The `seconds` widget on the empty latent is dead once the link exists.
  - A single `SeedNode` feeds BOTH `MiniMaxMusic3TextEncode.seed` and `KSampler.seed`, so one seed reproduces
    the whole song.
  - `KSampler` -> `VAEDecodeAudio` (VAE) and in parallel -> `VAEDecodeAudioTiled` (VAE, widgets `1536, 64`);
    a `ComfySwitchNode` picks between them -> `SaveAudioAdvanced` (`mp3`, `V0`).
- **Two stages with independent knobs, and that is the whole tuning story.** The autoregressive stage inside
  the text encode predicts structure and latent tokens; the flow-matching DiT under `KSampler` renders the
  waveform. So `cfg_scale` / `top_k` on the encode and `cfg` / `steps` on the `KSampler` are separate dials
  hitting separate stages, even though the template happens to set both cfg values to the same 1.7.
- **Settings the template actually ships:** `KSampler` steps **30**, cfg **1.7**, sampler `euler`, scheduler
  `simple`, denoise 1.0. Encode `max_duration` **60** s, `cfg_scale` **1.7**, `top_k` **50**. Node defaults in
  code are `cfg_scale` 1.5 and `top_k` 50 (`CFG_SCALE` / `CFG_TOP_K` in `comfy/ldm/minimax_music/ar.py`), so
  the template raises cfg and leaves top_k alone.
- **The real duration ceiling is 360 s, not the 5 minutes everyone quotes.** `max_duration`'s maximum is
  `MAX_AUDIO_FRAMES / AUDIO_FRAMES_PER_SECOND` = 9000 / 25 = **360 seconds**, read from
  `comfy/ldm/minimax_music/ar.py`. The template's own note says "up to ~300 s / 5 minutes"; that is the
  marketing figure, and it disagrees with the node. Step is 0.04 s (one audio frame).
- **Prompting, and the two fields do different jobs:**
  - **Caption** is the music description, written in three sections in this order: **Global Metadata** (genre,
    BPM, key, mood arc, listening context, production texture) -> **Vocal Details** (voice type, delivery,
    placement in the mix) -> **Arrangement** (instruments and how they enter). The shipped example opens
    literally `Global Metadata: Lo-fi hip-hop, chillhop. 78 BPM, D flat major...` and names production
    artefacts explicitly ("vinyl crackle, tape hiss and wow-flutter pitch wobble").
  - **Lyrics** carry the structure. **Section tags in square brackets are the only executable structural
    instruction**; the lyric text itself only conveys mood. The shipped example uses `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`,
    `[Instrumental]`, and parenthesised non-sung cues like `(rain on the window)`.
- **Low VRAM:** switch `UNETLoader` to the int8 build and flip the `ComfySwitchNode` to the tiled decode. Tiled
  decode cuts VRAM sharply at a small risk of seams at tile boundaries; leave it off on a large card.

### Seed Audio 1.0 (ByteDance)
- **Prompt style (this is the whole game):** write the scene as a SCRIPT and wrap everything that is NOT spoken dialogue in `[square brackets]` - only text in quotes after `says / whispers / replies` gets voiced. Un-bracketed prose is read aloud as narration and bloats the clip. Order: `[Language: ...]` -> `[Environment: ...]` -> `[Background music / SFX: ...]` -> `Name (voice traits) says: "line"` -> `[beats / SFX / Outro]`. Describe each voice (gender, age, accent, emotion, tone, pace) inside the parentheses before `says`.
- **Lock the language:** English + Chinese only, and it mixes them if you don't pin it. Put `[Language: English only.]` (or `Chinese only.`) near the top AND write "speaks English only" into each character's voice traits.
- **Limits (confirmed from the templates):** prompt <=3000 chars, output <=2 min.
- **Strengths:** ONE pass gives a FULL audio scene - ambience + multi-character dialogue (per-voice traits) + background music + SFX - not plain TTS or a music-tag list. Three modes on the same node.
- **Build the graph (confirmed from the official templates):** node **`ByteDanceSeedAudio`** -> **`SaveAudioAdvanced`** (widgets `mp3` / `V0`). Node widgets = prompt, a **mode combo**, `sample_rate` `24000`, seed + control_after_generate (leave the middle toggles at their defaults).
  - **t2a** - mode `text only`, no inputs. (Also the clean way to make a reference clip for ta2a.)
  - **ta2a** - mode `audio reference`; **`LoadAudio`** -> `reference_mode.reference_audio_1` (add `_2`, `_3` in order, no gaps, <=30s each). In the prompt tag each speaker `voiced by @Audio1 / @Audio2 / @Audio3` matching the connected clip - every `@AudioN` used must have a clip, and a speaker reuses the same `@AudioN` on later lines. `@Audio1` = `reference_audio_1`, etc.
  - **ti2a** - mode `image reference`; **`LoadImage`** -> `reference_mode.reference_image`; the image derives ONE character voice, the prompt still drives language + scene. Do NOT use `@AudioN` in this mode.
