# In-graph LLM nodes (Layer 3)

Several nodes let an LLM run as a step INSIDE a workflow (prompt enrichment, captioning, vision QA). Three are
Claude-specific (two even share the display name "Anthropic Claude"); a fourth, OpenRouter, reaches any model.
Pick by how the graph is billed and what it needs.

## AnthropicClaudeNode: the workhorse (your own key)

- class_type: `AnthropicClaudeNode` | display: "Anthropic Claude" | category: `LLM/Anthropic`
- source: community node `anthropic-claude` (alexmunteanu). `pip install anthropic>=0.40.0`.
- billing: your own Anthropic API key via the `CLAUDE_API_KEY` env var.
- why it matters: 40+ built-in templates that rewrite a prompt for a SPECIFIC generative model, `FLUX`,
  `Ideogram 3`, `LTX 2.3` / `LTX 2 Pro`, `Wan 2.1 & 2.2`, `Nano Banana`, `Veo 3`, `Sora 2`, `Qwen Image`,
  `Seedream`, and more. Vision (pass images for context), extended thinking, seed-based caching.
- use it for: autonomous in-graph prompt enrichment and "does this image match the topic" gating in unattended
  pipelines.
- setup: `setx CLAUDE_API_KEY "sk-ant-..."` (Windows) / `export CLAUDE_API_KEY=...`, then restart ComfyUI so
  the env is picked up. Without the key the node errors, but it does not affect other generation.

## ClaudeNode: official partner node (Comfy.org credits)

- class_type: `ClaudeNode` | display: "Anthropic Claude" | category: `partner/text/Anthropic`
- source: official Comfy-Org partner/API node. `api_node: true`.
- billing: Comfy.org account credits (hidden `auth_token_comfy_org` / `api_key_comfy_org`), no own key.
- models: up to the latest Opus. Vision up to 20 images.
- use it for: a quick path when you do not want to manage an Anthropic key, and the account has credits.

## ClaudeCustomPrompt: simple generator

- class_type: `ClaudeCustomPrompt` | display: "Claude Prompt Generator" | category: `prompt generation`
- source: `comfyui_claude_prompt_generator` (PauldeLavallaz). API key passed as a string input on the node.
- use it for: a minimal "system prompt + user input -> prompt string" node when you do not want the larger
  community node.

## OpenRouter LLM: any model via one key (template `api_openrouter_llm`)

- source: the official Comfy-Org `api_openrouter_llm` workflow template (node category `OpenRouter`); already in
  the template clone.
- billing: your own OpenRouter API key. One key reaches GPT, Claude, Gemini, **GLM**, Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and
  300+ models behind one OpenAI-style endpoint.
- why it matters: model-agnostic in-graph prompt enrichment / captioning / vision QA without committing to one
  vendor; the easiest way to run a non-Anthropic LLM (e.g. GLM, or a cheap fast model) as a graph step, and to
  A/B different LLMs for the rewriting quality.
- use it for: prompt rewriting, "describe this frame", topic gating. Load the `api_openrouter_llm` template as the
  pattern and swap the model id.

## Do you even need one?

For everything done WITH the agent in the loop, write the prompt yourself, it is better than the node templates
and free. Reach for Layer 3 only when a graph runs WITHOUT you (e.g. a bot's unattended auto-hero step).
