# ComfyUI at creator level: strengths, real limits, and advanced techniques

Distilled from primary sources (official docs and blog, the ComfyUI GitHub and its issues, model cards) on
2026-06-24. Every tool named below was checked against its real page; licenses are flagged because several are
non-commercial. This is the "know the engine, including where it bites" reference. Pair it with
[`MODELS.md`](MODELS.md) (per-model prompting) and [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md)
(driving and building). Where a claim is community consensus rather than a measured fact, it says so.

## What ComfyUI is genuinely best at

- **The graph IS the pipeline.** Every step (load, encode, sample, decode, save) is an exposed, rewireable node, so multi-model / multi-ControlNet / iterative-refine pipelines that are awkward in A1111/Forge/Invoke are first-class here. This is why it became the de-facto studio/automation backend.
- **Headless API + batch.** The server is headless by default; the web UI is just one client. `POST /prompt` (validate + queue), `GET /history`, `GET /view`, `GET /object_info` (every node's schema), `/ws` (live progress). Any HTTP client can drive it and scale it horizontally.
- **One graph across modalities.** image -> upscale -> video -> audio -> 3D in a single graph, mixing a different model per stage.
- **Reproducibility.** The full workflow with seeds is embedded in output PNG/WebP/FLAC and drag-droppable back into the canvas; only changed branches re-execute (caching). Caveat: re-encoding to WebP/JPG or resizing strips the metadata, so share the `.json`, not a screenshot.
- **Day-0 model support + the Registry.** A new architecture usually only needs a new loader node, so support often ships the day a model drops. The Comfy Registry adds semantic versioning ("reinstall the exact node version") and security scanning.
- **Subgraphs / blueprints** (collapse a stage into one reusable super-node), **deep control** (stacked ControlNet + IPAdapter + per-region masks + direct latent surgery), **Dynamic VRAM** (run models larger than VRAM, default since ~March 2026), and **partner/API nodes** (closed SOTA models as native nodes in the same graph).

## Real limits and gotchas (and the workaround)

Live status of these (newly fixed / newly appeared) is tracked weekly in [`KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](KNOWN_ISSUES.md).

- **Big graphs lag the canvas, not the backend.** litegraph renders the whole canvas on Canvas2D; 80+ node packs can drop to single-digit fps while the backend is fine. Workaround: collapse stages into subgraphs, mute/collapse groups, lower link-render quality in settings. (gh issues 7322, 4017)
- **Dynamic VRAM fixed OOMs but added regressions.** On some setups it reloads the whole model every generation (full unload then reload), is slower per-image on 4090/5090, or forces multi-GPU onto one card. Workaround: `--disable-dynamic-vram`. (Comfy-Org/ComfyUI discussion 12699 ; desktop issue 1741)
- **`--lowvram` / `--novram` still OOM at slightly higher res** because offload granularity does not cover peak activations. Workaround: tiled VAE decode, lower res, `--cache-none`.
- **VAE round-trip shifts color and contrast and compounds across passes;** fp16 VAE can overflow to NaN -> black images (SD1.5's fp32-trained VAE is the classic offender, but it still happens on newer fp8 models). Workaround: `--fp32-vae` (or `--bf16-vae`); encode once, stay in latent, decode once at the end; a histogram/LAB color-match node to restore the source plate. (gh issues 500, 13116, 2229)
- **The `IS_CHANGED` footgun.** A custom node that returns `True` to signal "I changed" reads as unchanged (`True == True`) and never re-runs; force a rerun with `return float("NaN")` (NaN != NaN). Caching can also serve a stale image after a seed change (queue runs in ~0.05s, nothing visibly happens). Workaround: bust an input, or `--cache-classic`. (docs/custom-nodes/backend/server_overview ; issue 11905)
- **Custom-node version hell and real malware.** A core or numpy 1.x->2.x bump can break half your packs; ComfyUI does not guarantee backward compat for internal symbols custom nodes import. Verified malware has shipped through the node channel (ComfyUI_LLMVISION, ultralytics, and Akira Stealer packages). Workaround: install only from verified authors, pin versions, prefer per-pack isolation. (blog/comfyui-2025-jan-security-update ; issues 11791, 9156, 11660 ; docs/development/core-concepts/dependencies)
- **No native layers / timeline / compositing, and no real color management** (sRGB/linear handled naively, ICC effectively ignored; production color needs OCIO/ACES nodes). Output is **not deterministic** even on one machine; `--deterministic` narrows it (slower). These are design choices, not bugs.
- **Manual transforms belong in log, not linear.** Any non-AI pixel geometry (scale, rotate, distort, warp, skew, any resample) crushes highlight / shadow detail when done on linear data. Wrap it: convert Linear->Log, do the transform, convert Log->Linear. We ship the node for this as `OCIOLogConvert` in our ComfyUI-OCIO pack (v1.2.2; Cineon / ACEScc / ACEScct, plus `logc3` = ARRI LogC3 for LTX-2 HDR; HDR-safe, reversible; the whole pack is now on ComfyUI's native VIDEO wire too). A production practice; carry float through the wrap and persist EXR via `SaveImageAdvanced` if needed. Full entry + the native EXR/linear path: `docs/NODE_LIBRARY/color-and-transform.md`.
- **Myth check:** ComfyUI is NOT slower than A1111 (roughly equal-to-faster, ~15-25% less VRAM in community benchmarks). The real cost is the steep curve and build/iteration friction, not throughput.

## Temporal stability / anti-flicker for sequences

The 2026 stack moved from SD-era flow hacks to native video models. Honest hierarchy, best first:

1. **Use a native video model** (it enforces frame coherence inside the model, not as a post-pass): **Wan 2.2** (+ **VACE** for control / vid2vid / inpaint), **HunyuanVideo 1.5**, **LTX-2**. Far more stable than per-frame image diffusion. Wan 2.2 leads on photoreal humans, HunyuanVideo 1.5 on natural motion/physics, LTX-2 trades some coherence for speed (rankings are practitioner consensus, not a controlled flicker benchmark).
2. **Length** via **WanVideoWrapper** context windows (`uniform_looped` / `uniform_standard` / `static_standard`, with blend masks) + **FreeNoise** (reuse/permute window noise so frames correlate). SD1.5/SDXL equivalent: **AnimateDiff-Evolved** sliding Context Options + FreeNoise.
3. **Lock structure** with per-frame **depth/pose ControlNet** (`comfyui_controlnet_aux`: DepthAnythingV2, DWPose). This suppresses geometry flicker; it does NOT lock texture or identity.
4. **SD-era vid2vid** (when not using a video model): **unsampling** (Flip Sigma node + a converging sampler like Euler, NOT Euler-a; turn add-noise OFF on the resample or you reintroduce flicker; weak ControlNet) + flow attention (**Veevee**, **FLATTEN**, both stale and SD-only now).
5. **Finishers, not fixers:** RIFE / FILM interpolation smooths judder but can hide flicker and ghost on fast motion; **SuperBeasts** Deflicker / PixelDeflicker fixes luminance shimmer only (it is temporal blur and will smear fine detail). Use lightly.
6. **Cheap levers:** fixed seed, "prompt lock" (tiny prompt deltas only), reuse stage-1's seed in a multi-stage upscale, and **SeedVR2** video upscaler (temporally coherent, needs batch >= 5 to engage).

**What still flickers (say so):** fine texture and identity (hair, fabric weave, foliage) that depth/pose do not constrain, context-window seams despite blend masks, and high-denoise restyling. The realistic recipe: native video model + VACE depth/pose + context windows + FreeNoise, then optional light RIFE + a light Deflicker pass.

## PBR / material passes from a sequence (the honest state)

**Native, high-quality, temporally-stable PBR from arbitrary 2D footage is NOT solved in ComfyUI in 2026.** Tell users this plainly, then give the closest real path. The reason: every quality single-image material model is one independent diffusion sample per frame, so running it on a clip flickers (swimming normals, shifting albedo, jittery roughness).

- **Single-image decomposition (run per-frame, then fight flicker externally):**
  - **Marigold + IID** (`kijai/ComfyUI-Marigold`, GPL-3.0 node wrapper; the Marigold model weights are Apache-2.0) - the practical route: depth, normals, and Intrinsic Image Decomposition into albedo + roughness + metallic (Appearance) or albedo + shading (Lighting).
  - **StableNormal + StableDelight** (`Stable-X`, via `kijai/ComfyUI-StableXWrapper`, no LICENSE file; the Stable-X models are Apache-2.0) - sharp/stable normals and specular removal (de-light toward true albedo).
  - **StableMaterials** (`gvecchio/StableMaterials`, openrail, commercial-OK) - basecolor/normal/height/roughness/metallic, tileable, but it SYNTHESIZES a material rather than faithfully decomposing your exact frame. Load the pipeline with `trust_remote_code=True` (custom pipeline, won't run without it); recommended `guidance_scale=10.0`, `num_inference_steps=50` (or the LCM fast variant: load subfolder `unet_lcm` + swap in `LCMScheduler`, 4 steps); `inference: false` in the card means no hosted API, run it locally.
  - **DeepBump** (`HugoTini/DeepBump` via `comfy_mtb`, GPL-3.0) - normal + height only, filter-grade.
  - **QFX-PBRGenerator** / **TextureAlchemy** - full-channel packs, but their "intelligence" is mostly Marigold/Lotus underneath plus procedural tooling (tiling, channel-pack, AO/curvature).
  - **Higher fidelity but NON-COMMERCIAL:** **rgb2x / RGB-X** (`zheng95z/rgbx` + `toyxyz/ComfyUI_rgbx_Wrapper`; albedo/normal/roughness/metallic/irradiance; Adobe Research, noncommercial) and **Ubisoft CHORD** (`ubisoft/ComfyUI-Chord`; full basecolor/normal/height/roughness/metalness; Ubisoft research-only license).
- **The only true temporal method:** **NVIDIA UniRelight** (`nv-tlabs/UniRelight`) denoises the whole clip jointly so attention enforces cross-frame consistency. But it is NVIDIA noncommercial, has NO ComfyUI node, and outputs albedo + relit video only (no metallic/roughness/height).
- **3D route (real PBR, but UV/mesh space, not aligned per-frame passes):** **TRELLIS.2** (`microsoft/TRELLIS.2-4B`, MIT, commercial-OK) and **Hunyuan3D-2.1** emit basecolor/roughness/metallic on a generated mesh. Cleaner PBR, but it solves "make a 3D asset," not "decompose my footage." CAVEATS for TRELLIS.2-4B: it is NOT a ComfyUI node and NOT a diffusers pipeline - it needs the `microsoft/TRELLIS.2` GitHub stack (the `trellis2` + `o_voxel` packages) installed; it is LINUX-ONLY, needs 24GB+ VRAM, and was tested on A100/H100 only (consumer RTX GPUs untested, CUDA 12.4 recommended). Image-to-3D (single image -> GLB mesh with PBR); resolution/speed tradeoff 512 cubed (~3s H100) / 1024 cubed (~17s) / 1536 cubed (~60s); base model with NO RLHF alignment (style varies with the training distribution), and raw meshes may have small holes needing post-process hole-fill.
- **Realistic recipe for a sequence today:** decompose each frame with the Apache-2.0 stack (Marigold-IID for albedo/roughness/metallic, StableNormal for normals, StableDelight to kill specular), then add an explicit temporal pass (optical-flow warp + blend, the `pablodawson/Marigold-Video` technique) to suppress flicker. It reduces, not eliminates, flicker; metallic and height are the least reliable channels (single-photo material is physically ambiguous, so there is a real precision ceiling). For commercial cleanliness stay on Apache/openrail tools and avoid rgb2x / CHORD / UniRelight.

## Max detail, precision, and sequence-native VFX I/O

- **Tiled detail at high res:** **Ultimate SD Upscale** (`ssitu/ComfyUI_UltimateSDUpscale`, GPL-3.0) or **Tiled Diffusion / MultiDiffusion + Tiled VAE** (`shiimizu/ComfyUI-TiledDiffusion`; note the MultiDiffusion part is CC-BY-NC-SA). Kill seams with a **ControlNet Tile** (conditions each tile on the source colors, the single biggest seam/drift reducer), higher tile overlap + mask blur, low denoise (~0.2-0.35), or SpotDiffusion / Context-Only-Overlap. For max detail prefer **upscale-then-refine** (ESRGAN-class upscale -> tiled img2img refine at low denoise) over hi-res fix. Another tiler is **`Steudio/ComfyUI_Steudio`** (Divide and Conquer suite, ~141 stars): it computes the optimal upscale resolution, splits the image into seamless tiles you process with any sub-workflow, then merges them back - a drop-in alternative when you want automatic tile-sizing rather than hand-set tiles (community-endorsed, not benchmarked here). All three tile the SAMPLING but not the PROMPT: every tile gets the same text, or a captioner describes each tile in isolation, which is why a crop of roof becomes "brown texture" and neighbouring tiles disagree at the seam. Our own **Smart Upscaler** pack (`docs/NODE_LIBRARY/smart-upscaler.md`, MIT, not published yet) is the prompt-aware option: it reads the whole image once, then derives a separate verified prompt for every tile, with flat regions found by measuring pixels rather than asking a model. Heavier than all three (a vision pass plus one caption per tile before any sampling), so it earns its cost on busy or mixed scenes, not on uniform subjects.
- **Detail injection (training-free):** **Detail Daemon** (`Jonseed/ComfyUI-Detail-Daemon`, MIT; biases the sigma schedule to keep fine detail, adds no noise), the **PAG / SEG / NAG / FDG** family (`pamparamm/sd-perturbed-attention`, MIT), and **FreeU** (core node). All are tuning knobs that can over-sharpen or over-saturate.
- **Removing model refusals (abliterated text encoders):** modern DiTs increasingly use an instruction-tuned LLM/VLM as the text encoder (Krea 2 and Qwen-Image both ride `Qwen3-VL`), which inherits that model's alignment - so it can quietly steer away from legit-but-flagged VFX content (wounds / gore for horror, weapons, real people or brands, "disturbing" imagery a safety-aligned encoder over-blocks). An **abliterated** encoder (the refusal direction ablated by activation steering, e.g. `huihui-ai/Huihui-Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-abliterated`, ComfyUI repack `ahmed22xa/...-comfy`) is a drop-in TE swap that encodes the prompt faithfully instead of refusing. It changes only the encoder's willingness, not the model's capability, and still carries the base model's acceptable-use terms - keep it to content you are licensed and allowed to make. Per-model wiring + the full community build (uncensored UNET merge + LoKr) is in MODELS.md (Krea 2). **On-request reference, not a promoted feature: apply it when a task actually needs it, do not proactively suggest it.**
- **Precision:** fidelity is fp32 >= bf16 >= fp8. Decode the VAE in fp32 or bf16, never fp16 for VFX. fp8 speeds sampling on FP8-tensor-core GPUs but loses quality (mostly in the UNet).
- **INT8 acceleration (integer weights: half the FP16 size, faster than FP16, matches or beats FP8):** as of
  ComfyUI **v0.27.0** (2026-06-30) INT8 weight quantization is **native**, via the **ConvRot** method (arXiv
  2512.03673, "ConvRot: Rotation-Based Plug-and-Play 4-bit Quantization for Diffusion Transformers"). ConvRot is a
  rotation-based quant that GROUPS the rotation instead of rotating the whole weight matrix, dropping the cost from
  quadratic to linear, and cancels the outlier / "column-imbalance" distortion with an optimal rotation matrix.
  Result: an `int8-convrot` checkpoint is ~half the size of FP16, runs FASTER than FP16, and does not lose to
  (often beats) FP8 on image / video quality. Integer INT8 is also faster + cleaner than FP8 on Turing / Ampere
  tensor cores (RTX 20xx / 30xx - v0.27.0 explicitly added Turing support), and the smaller weights bring modern
  models within reach of 8-12 GB (and even Pascal GTX 10xx) cards. Measured (LTXV 2.3, 1920x1088, RTX 5090): base
  268 s vs int8-convrot 140 s. v0.27.0 also fixed INT8 LoRA quality/speed and an INT8 memory leak. **Convert** a
  bf16 model with Comfy's own **`Comfy-Org/comfy-model-tools`** (`quant_int8_convrot.py`, dry-run first); Comfy-Org is
  uploading official int8-convrot weights to HF (Wan 2.2 Animate, Z-Image, SeedVR2, more). **INT4 is native as of
  v0.28.0** (`Support convrot int4 models`, PR #14859), with a same-release fix for **black images on Turing when
  using int4 models** (PR #14864) - so on RTX 20xx make sure you are on v0.28.0 or later before blaming the quant.
  v0.28.0 also shipped official int8 TEMPLATES across the library (Z-Image, Ideogram 4 t2i, Qwen-Image-Edit 2511,
  Boogu edit, SeedVR2 3B/7B, Wan SCAIL2), so int8 is now a first-class path, not just a converter. **Known bug:**
  an open core issue reports `int8 model cause PC crash` (comfyanonymous/ComfyUI#14985, opened 2026-07-18) - treat
  int8 as fast but not yet bulletproof, and see KNOWN_ISSUES.md. The method covers DiT / LLM / multimodal / UNet. This makes the earlier community pack
  **`BobJohnson24/ComfyUI-INT8-Fast`** (which pioneered ComfyUI INT8, incl. the `INT8-ConvRot` quants some models
  like Flux2-Klein-9B-True-V3 shipped) **fully superseded** - use the native v0.27.0 path. Quality still trails
  bf16/fp16, so keep INT8 for speed passes, not final-grade VFX plates. Source:

- **Color and bit depth:** SaveImage clamps to 8-bit PNG by default (banding on gradients/depth). For VFX use 32-bit EXR I/O: **`spacepxl/ComfyUI-HQ-Image-Save`** (32-bit float EXR for images AND latents, `%04d` sequences, MIT) and **`Conor-Collins/ComfyUI-CoCoTools_IO`** (Load EXR Sequence, EXR layer / Cryptomatte, OCIO colorspace sRGB / Linear / ACEScg, MIT). Convert sRGB -> Linear before saving a linear EXR or you double-apply gamma.
- **Generate HDR, not just tone-map it:** the LumiVid line (arXiv 2604.11788) trains a model to emit an ARRI-Log-encoded frame that decodes to scene-linear HDR (values past 1.0) - real highlight headroom an 8-bit source never had. Two ready routes: **video** = the LTX-2.3 HDR IC-LoRA; **single image** = **LumiPic** (`oumoumad/LumiPic`) on Qwen-Image-Edit / Flux.2 Klein (MODELS.md). Decode the Log `[0,1]` to linear with **`ComfyUI_Gear`**'s LogC3 / LogC4 Decode + Save EXR node (`custom-author.md`), or - for an ACES master - our **ComfyUI-OCIO**: `OCIOLogConvert(logc3)` then `OCIOColorSpace(Rec.709 -> ACEScg)` -> `OCIO Write`. Match the decode curve to the LoRA (`_logc4_*` = LogC4, else LogC3) or the absolute luminance is silently wrong. NOTE: our OCIO ships LogC3 but NOT yet LogC4 - use Gear for the LogC4 (V10) LoRAs until we add it.
- **Samplers for detail:** `dpmpp_2m` (or `_sde`) with the **Karras** scheduler spends more steps in the low-sigma region where fine detail forms; ~20-35 steps is the sweet spot, more is diminishing returns.
- **The core tension:** per-frame max detail flickers; cross-frame stability blurs detail. Resolve it three ways: (a) a sequence-native upscaler that does both (**SeedVR2**, batch >= 5, `temporal_overlap`); (b) lock structure (low denoise + ControlNet Tile) and vary only fine detail; (c) detail-pass then a light deflicker. The deflicker window and SeedVR2 batch size are the explicit dials.

## High-detail matting / alpha extraction (hair, fur, semi-transparent, motion blur)

Pulling a clean alpha with hair/fur edges and fractional (semi-transparent) pixels is a multi-stage job, not one node. Trimap-free segmenters give near-binary silhouettes; true soft alpha needs a trimap/prompt model or a video-memory model. Per-frame matting of a sequence flickers unless the model is temporal.

**Still image, VFX-grade edges (the pipeline):** coarse select (SAM3, BiRefNet, or GroundingDINO) -> build a trimap (erode/dilate the coarse mask, or auto-trimap) -> alpha matte (ViTMatte for trimap-driven; SDMatte or Matte-Anything for prompt-driven, both stronger on transparency) -> edge refine (LayerStyle `MaskEdgeUltraDetailV2`, a local ViTMatte pass that captures hair and semi-transparent edges).
- One-node commercial-safe default: **BiRefNet_HR-matting** (2048, transparency-trained, MIT) or **InSPyReNet** (transparent-background, MIT).
- Best modern soft alpha on transparent objects: **SDMatte** (vivo, ICCV 2025, diffusion prior, MIT) or **Matte-Anything** (SAM -> auto-trimap -> ViTMatte, MIT).
- Hub pack bundling RMBG-2.0 / INSPYRENET / BEN2 / BiRefNet / SDMatte / SAM2 / SAM3: **ComfyUI-RMBG** (1038lab, GPL-3.0).

**Video / temporal (stable alpha across frames):** the per-frame segmenters above shimmer on a sequence (no frame-to-frame coupling). Use a temporal model:
- **MatAnyone** (CVPR 2025) and **MatAnyone2** (CVPR 2026 Highlight) - consistent memory propagation, true soft alpha that targets hair, semi-transparency, and motion blur. It is a PROPAGATOR, not a detector: it needs a first-frame (keyframe) mask from SAM2 / SAM3 / SeC. Memory flags `max_mem_frames` / `use_long_term` / `max_internal_size` trade quality for VRAM on long clips. Wrappers: FuouM/ComfyUI-MatAnyone (MIT), spiritform/comfy-matanyone2. **License: NTU S-Lab 1.0 (research-only).**
- **Robust Video Matting (RVM)** - older, human-only, detector-free, very fast (4K@76fps); the zero-setup fallback for clean human shots. GPL-3.0; the ComfyUI-Video-Matting wrapper is stale (2024).
- **Turnkey local pipeline:** `Code2Collapse/ComfyUI-CustomNodePacks` (Apache-2.0) ships a single "SeC + MatAnyone2" node (coarse concept-segment -> temporal matte) and a "SAM + ViTMatte" image node.
- **Recipe:** SAM2/SAM3/SeC keyframe mask -> MatAnyone2 temporal alpha -> optional edge refine -> composite.

**Ready workflows (checked the official library 2026-06):** Comfy-Org `workflow_templates` ships `remove_background_birefnet` (image, local BiRefNet matte) and `image/video_segmentation_sam3` (coarse, binary). There is **NO free local temporal video-matte template** - the only shipped video-matte templates are Bria API nodes (paid cloud: `api_bria_remove_video_background`). Build the local temporal pipeline yourself or use the Code2Collapse pack.

**Honest limits:** true transparency (glass, smoke, veils) and fast motion-blur edges are where every one of these is weakest. MatAnyone CLAIMS them but it is research-grade and untested on arbitrary plates; thin flyaway wisps are the hardest case; per-frame models shimmer; trimap-free models bias interior alpha to opaque; 4K is checkpoint/tile dependent, not free; a bad coarse mask propagates as a bad matte. None replace hand roto on a hero transparency shot.

**License map:** commercial-safe MIT - BiRefNet, ViTMatte, Matte-Anything, SDMatte, InSPyReNet, LayerStyle, SeC, the Code2Collapse pack. Flag: RMBG-2.0 (CC BY-NC, noncommercial), MatAnyone / MatAnyone2 (NTU S-Lab research-only), RVM and ComfyUI-RMBG (GPL-3.0 copyleft).

**RMBG-2.0 load caveats:** the model is GATED on HF - accept the license + use a token to download (an unauthenticated `from_pretrained` returns 401), and loading requires `trust_remote_code=True` (omitting it fails with a load error). Both omissions cause silent failures when an agent tries to use it without the right credentials or load flag.

## Detailed inpainting on a high-res image (crop and stitch)

Inpainting or detail-fixing a small region of a large image directly is wasteful and off-resolution: run the model on the full canvas and it is slow and OOM-prone; downsample the whole image and the result goes soft. The fix is **crop and stitch** - crop only the masked region, size that crop to the model's native resolution, generate, then composite it back into the full-res original. This is how you add a person, fix hands/faces, or do detailed edits without regenerating the whole image.

- **Established:** `comfyui-inpaint-cropandstitch` (Comfy Registry) - the proven crop/stitch node pair, used in the Flux.2 masked-inpaint recipe here.
- **Auto-sizing alternative (new):** **HallettVisual Smart Image Crop and Stitch** (Apache-2.0), nodes `SmartImageCrop` + `SmartImageStitcher`. It auto-sizes the crop to the model's native resolution AND your GPU limits (`force_divisibility` keeps it VAE/model-friendly), with no-mask modes (Bypass / Resize Full / Crop Full) and a stitcher that blends + color-matches on the way back, so the manual crop-sizing this pattern normally needs goes away. Ships a ready Flux Klein workflow. New as of mid-2026 and lightly battle-tested, so prefer the established node for production until it matures.
- **Flow (either tool):** source `IMAGE` + `MASK` -> crop node -> process `crop_image` / `crop_mask` with your inpaint / detail / upscale graph -> stitcher node (+ the original image + the crop's stitch-info) -> final full-res image.
- **Official workflow:** `Klein Smart Crop and Stitch Hallett.json` in the repo's `workflows/` (Flux Klein: UNETLoader + ReferenceLatent + SamplerCustomAdvanced feeding the two Smart nodes). Fetch the exact file rather than rebuilding it from memory.

## Combine two specific people (multi-reference identity compositing)

Putting two named faces (the user + a target person) into one believable image is reference-conditioning, not a from-scratch prompt. Recipe (adapted from `Comfy-Org/comfy-skills`, MIT):
- **Two real references are essential.** Without a reference of the second person the model leans on training data and misses the likeness. Have only a name? Generate a clean reference portrait first (Nano Banana 2 / Pro, or a strong edit model), then feed THAT back as reference 2.
- **Batch then edit.** Combine both refs with `ImageBatch` (`image1` = the user, `image2` = the other person) and feed the batch into a reference-capable edit model.
- **Face accuracy (from testing):** Nano Banana 2 at `thinking_level: HIGH` (best) > Nano Banana Pro > Kling O3 (`kling-v3-omni`) > FLUX Kontext (single-ref only, moderate) > SDXL img2img (poor). Fully local path: Qwen-Image-Edit handles two-image edits, identity accuracy below Nano Banana 2.
- **Name which ref is which in the prompt:** "The first image is [A] - reproduce this face EXACTLY (features, hair, ...); the second image shows [B] - reproduce their face exactly; they pose together in [setting], [style]. Important: NO glare on glasses, NO lens reflections." Stating which image is whom dramatically improves the likeness.
- **Run 3 seeds in parallel** (face reproduction varies by seed), let the user pick, then refine on the same seed (stay close) plus new ones.

**Wan2.1-VACE-14B (Apache-2.0) recipe:** three input modes - R2V (`src_ref_images`, no preprocessing), V2V (`src_video`, needs preprocessing for depth/pose), MV2V (masked video editing, needs preprocessing); V2V/MV2V run the `vace_preproccess.py` step, R2V skips it. Resolution targets: 480P (~81x480x832) and 720P (~81x720x1280) - the 14B supports both, the 1.3B is 480P only. CLI: `--model_name vace-14B` (or `vace-1.3B`) with `--src_ref_images` / `--src_video` / `--src_mask`; a negative prompt is recommended (same boilerplate as T2V/I2V).

## Training a LoRA inside ComfyUI, natively (core, no wrapper pack)

ComfyUI core carries a working LoRA training path, and as of 2026-08 it gained the data-prep layer that was
missing. Status: the trainer is in released core; the **16 dataset nodes are on master only** and had not landed
in a tagged release as of 2026-08-06, so check your build before promising them.

**The trainer** (`comfy_extras/nodes_train.py`): **`TrainLoraNode`** ("Train LoRA") returns `lora`, a `loss_map`
and `steps`; **`SaveLoRA`** ("Save LoRA Weights") writes it out; **`LoraModelLoader`** ("Load LoRA Model") loads
one back; **`LossGraphNode`** ("Plot Loss Graph") renders the loss curve so you can see divergence rather than
guess at it.

**The dataset layer** (`comfy_extras/nodes_dataset.py`, 16 nodes, master):
- **Load:** `LoadImageDataSetFromFolder`, `LoadImageTextDataSetFromFolder` (image plus caption pairs, the shape
  LoRA training actually wants), `LoadVideoDataSetFromFolder`, `LoadVideoTextDataSetFromFolder`. Images are
  PNG / JPG / JPEG / WEBP, videos MP4 / AVI / MOV / WEBM / MKV / FLV.
- **Save:** `SaveImageDataSetToFolder`, `SaveImageTextDataSetToFolder` (captions written as sidecar TXT).
- **Shuffle:** `ShuffleImageTextDataset`, `ShuffleVideoDataset`, `ShuffleVideoTextDataset`.
- **Video sampling:** `VideoFrameSample` (fixed frame count by strategy), `VideoTemporalCrop`,
  `VideoRandomTemporalCrop` - the pieces for turning long clips into training-length segments.
- **`ResolutionBucket`** - the classic multi-aspect bucketing step, so a mixed-aspect set trains without
  everybody being squashed to one square.
- **`MakeTrainingDataset`, `SaveTrainingDataset`, `LoadTrainingDataset`** - build a dataset once, persist it,
  reuse it across runs instead of re-walking folders every time.

**Why this matters for the kit:** a caption-paired dataset, bucketing, shuffling and a trainer with a loss plot
is the whole loop, in-graph, with no external trainer to install. For LTX-2 specifically the official Lightricks
trainer is still the deeper route (`docs/LTX2_TRAINING.md`); this native path is the general one and it is the
right first suggestion when someone wants a style or subject LoRA without leaving ComfyUI.

## Gaussian splats are native now (master, 2026-08)

`comfy_extras/nodes_gaussian_splat.py` adds 3D Gaussian splatting to core with two new IO types, **`IO.Splat`**
and **`IO.File3DSplatAny`**. Eight nodes: **`RenderSplat`** ("Render Splat", an anisotropic EWA rasterizer, width
and height to 2048, and a `frames` input so it can render a sequence rather than one still),
**`CreateCameraInfo`** (the camera the render sees from), **`TransformSplat`**, **`MergeSplat`**,
**`GetSplatCount`**, **`SplatToMesh`** ("Extract Mesh from Splat", a coloured mesh), plus **`SplatToFile3D`** /
**`File3DToSplat`** to serialise into and out of the File3D object the Save / Preview 3D nodes already use.

For a VFX pipeline this is the interesting one: splats in, camera move, render a frame sequence out, or convert
to mesh for a conventional 3D package. Same status caveat, master only as of 2026-08-06.
