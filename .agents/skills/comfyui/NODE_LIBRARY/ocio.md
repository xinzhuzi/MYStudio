# OCIO color management (ComfyUI-OCIO, our own pack)

**Eleven** OpenColorIO nodes we build and maintain, modelled 1:1 on The Foundry Nuke's node set. Pack:
**`ComfyUI-OCIO`**, author **Slava Sexton** (https://github.com/SlavaSexton/ComfyUI-OCIO), MIT, **released v1.3.0
2026-08-16** (v1.2.2 was 2026-07-06, v1.0.0 2026-06-30). Category `OCIO`. Built to fill a real gap: the ComfyUI
registry had no OCIO pack (`search_custom_nodes "OCIO"` / `"OpenColorIO"` both return nothing).

The node count is **11**, counted by reading the three `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS` dicts at tag `v1.3.0`: six color
operators in `nodes.py`, `OCIORead` / `OCIOWrite` / `OCIOPlayer` in `io_nodes.py`, and `OCIOVAEDecode` /
`OCIOVAEEncode` in `vae_nodes.py`. **An `OCIO Metadata` node was registered on 2026-08-13 and removed the same
day**; it is not in the pack, and the only part of it that survives is the read-only Metadata panel on OCIO
Read. There is no replacement for EDITING metadata, so do not send anyone looking for one. Checked
exhaustively: `OCIOMetadata` appears as neither a class nor a mapping key in any of the 66 Python files at the
tag.

**Counting the mappings naively gives 14, and 14 is wrong.** `grade_nodes.py` defines and maps `OCIOGrade`,
`OCIOGradeMatch` and `OCIOApplyGrade`, but `__init__.py` has its import AND both `.update()` calls commented
out (disabled 2026-07-04, not in use). They are dead code, not nodes. **Read `__init__.py` before trusting a
`NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS` scan of any pack** - a mapping that nothing imports registers nothing.

## NEW IN v1.3.0 - the VAE pair, and one BREAKING rename

**BREAKING, and it is the first thing to fix in any saved graph: OCIO Write's `from_colorspace` is now
`input_colorspace`** (renamed 2026-08-16, to the name OCIO Read and OCIO Player already used). Three layers
behave differently and confusing them wastes an afternoon:

- **API-format workflow (what an agent builds and POSTs to `/prompt`): the old key is REFUSED.** ComfyUI
  validates against `INPUT_TYPES` before the node runs, so a graph carrying `from_colorspace` fails with HTTP
  400 `required_input_missing` (measured by the pack author, stated in the code comment at the widget). **The
  fix is one word in the JSON.** This is the case that matters for this kit.
- **GUI-format workflow saved from the canvas: unaffected.** `widgets_values` is a positional array and the
  key stayed SECOND in `required`, so an existing graph resolves exactly as before. A test asserts the position.
- **Python callers** (the pack's own `tools/`, `docker/`, anything driving `OCIOWrite.write()` directly) still
  accept a `from_colorspace=` kwarg. It only wins when `input_colorspace` is still at its default, which is the
  one state where preferring it cannot overwrite a real choice.

**`OCIOVAEDecode` (display "OCIO VAE Decode")** - the reason the release exists. The stock `VAEDecode` clamps
every decode to 0..1, which flattens the foot of the curve before any color node can reach it, and it rescales
output from VAEs whose own transform already emits 0..1.
- **inputs:** `samples` (LATENT, the same input stock VAE Decode takes), `vae` (VAE), `precision`
  (default **`float32`**), `clamp` (BOOLEAN, default **False**, labels `clamp to 0..1` / `keep everything`).
- **outputs:** `IMAGE` named `image/sequence/video`, and a STRING named **`range report`**.
- **cost, from the node's own tooltip:** float32 costs **5.2x** the model's own dtype, 28.8 s against 5.5 s for
  25 frames at 1280x704 tiled 384. `float16` applies only where the VAE lists it; LTX does not, so it falls
  back and the report says so.
- Turn `clamp` ON only to reproduce the stock path for a comparison. OFF is the point of the node.

**`OCIOVAEEncode` (display "OCIO VAE Encode")** - the other end of the round trip, and it reports the range of
what it was handed BEFORE the latent exists, so out-of-range input is seen rather than inferred afterwards.
- **inputs:** `pixels` (IMAGE), `vae` (VAE), `precision` (default `float32`, **1.8x** cost: 5.4 s against 3.0 s
  for 25 frames at 1280x704), `out_of_range` (combo **`report only`** / `clamp to 0..1` / `raise an error`).
- **outputs:** `LATENT` named `latent`, and a STRING named **`input report`**.
- Values outside 0..1 are outside the VAE's training domain. `report only` matches the stock node but tells you.

**Wire them like the stock pair:** `OCIOVAEDecode` replaces `VAEDecode` between the sampler and any color node;
`OCIOVAEEncode` replaces `VAEEncode` on the way in. Both return their report as a second STRING output, so wire
it to `PreviewAny` rather than guessing whether anything was out of range.

**Other v1.3.0 changes worth knowing:**
- **`view` narrows live to what the resolved display accepts.** It used to offer the union of every view across
  both ACES configs, of which **24 of 32 real entries were invalid** for `Rec.1886 Rec.709 - Display`, and
  picking one raised at render time after the graph had already spent its time. It never coerces: a view
  restored from a saved workflow stays selected even when the pair cannot use it, with the label saying so.
- **`view` now fills itself in with ACES 1.3, not the loaded config's 2.0 default.** A Nuke 13 or 14 comp is on
  ACES 1.2 / 1.3, and a render made with the wrong version is **off by 35.5% on the worst pixel**.
- **The `/ocio/thumb` endpoint stopped clamping.** It decoded video through `rgb48le`, which pushes the YUV
  matrix into an unsigned integer format and clamps on the way out, so the viewport and the thumbnail showed
  different pictures. Measured on a flat limited-range frame: the file carries green at **-0.0937** and the
  thumbnail returned exactly **0.0**.
- **OCIO Player takes an `AUDIO` input**, and gained **`Range check`** in its Info panel, reading e.g.
  `max 1.017, min -0.008, 0.070% above 1.0` or `nothing above 1.0 (no highlights to recover)`. That line is
  what tells a display-referred master apart from a broken viewer: pulling exposure down on the former darkens
  the picture and reveals nothing, which looks identical to a bug.
- `write_audio` now appears only where sound can arrive without a wire, which is a native `VIDEO` input.
- Gate at the release: **45 passed, 0 failed**, and three of the five added test files execute the front-end
  JavaScript under node rather than grepping it for a function name.

**The pack (v1.2.2) - native ComfyUI VIDEO pipeline, an on-node viewer, CI-verified accuracy.** (The nine nodes then registered and
the VIDEO wire shipped in v1.2.0; v1.2.1 / v1.2.2 add the reproducible CI and an honest accuracy write-up, no node
changes.)
- **All nine of the pre-v1.3.0 nodes are on the native VIDEO wire.** Each of the six color nodes (ColorSpace, LogConvert, Display,
  CDLTransform, FileTransform, LookTransform) plus Write and Player carries a **mutually-exclusive IMAGE-or-VIDEO
  input pair**: connect one and the other auto-disconnects, and the socket matching the live input carries the
  data (VIDEO in -> VIDEO out, IMAGE in -> IMAGE out). VIDEO uses ComfyUI's native `comfy_api`
  `VideoFromComponents` - the SAME type Load Video emits - so the nodes drop straight into a native video graph
  (`Load Video -> OCIO color node -> Video Combine / Save Video`) and interop with Load / Save Video, Video
  Combine, Get Video Components, VHS. Slot labels read `OCIO Img/Seq/Vid` (image) and `ComfyUI Video` (video).
- **OCIO Player (the 9th node)** - an on-node WebGL viewport: exposure + the OCIO display transform run in the
  fragment shader on the real HALF-float values (a 3D LUT baked server-side from `getProcessor`), with a
  **scene-linear HDR log shaper** so highlights above 1.0 do NOT clip flat in the display LUT.
- **LogConvert curves now carry readable labels** ("Sony S-Log3", "ARRI LogC3", "Linear to Log", ...).
- **Accuracy, honestly stated (v1.2.2):** the headline number is **per-transform bit-exact parity - 0.000e+00**
  worst max-abs error across 9 transforms x 4 fixtures (OCIO forward vs inverse). The full end-to-end round-trip
  `ACEScg -> ARRI LogC -> Rec.709 -> back` in raw 32-bit float returns to source at **4.5e-6 max / 3.1e-8 mean**
  abs error - reversible to floating-point precision, the residual being OCIO's single-precision LUT
  interpolation. It is NOT bit-for-bit lossless, but ~100x finer than one half-float EXR step near 1.0, so a 16f
  delivery never resolves it. The `histogram_compare` chart is a distribution-shape sanity check, NOT an accuracy
  proof. Backed by a color-accuracy suite (`tools/accuracy`) + charts (`docs/assets/accuracy/`, incl. a 3D
  gamut-volume chart of sRGB / ACEScg / ACES2065-1 / ARRI Wide Gamut 3 in CIE Lab).
- **Reproducible CI (v1.2.1+):** a Dockerized CPU-only ComfyUI test env (`docker/`, CPU-only, no models) drives
  all nine of those nodes headless through the real ComfyUI HTTP API and gates the round-trip on every push / PR (GitHub
  Actions) - CI-confirming that those 9 nodes register and the round-trip holds at 4.5e-6. The Docker / CI
  round-trip harness was contributed by **Sam Hodge** (PR #1); the nodes and the color-accuracy suite are Slava
  Sexton's.
- **Since v1.0.1** (still current): OCIO Write can write LTX-2 HDR straight to an **ACEScg EXR sequence** -
  automatically (`auto_colorspace` from LTX's HDR decode) or by hand (the `logc3` ARRI LogC3 curve on
  OCIOLogConvert); **colorspace in the file name** (`name_acescg.0086.exr`, `colorspace_in_name`); Nuke-Write-style
  **EXR compression** (`compression`: zip / zips / piz / pxr24 / dwaa / dwab / rle / none). `pyproject.toml` is now
  correctly `1.2.2` (the earlier v1.0.1 version-string lag is fixed). Full node I/O for Player / the video sockets:
  the pack README + `io_nodes.py` / `nodes.py` at tag `v1.2.2`.

**The two that make it a pipeline:** **OCIO Read** and **OCIO Write** - load a still / image sequence / video
off disk, color-manage it, and write it back out in EXR / TIFF / PNG / JPEG or ProRes / DNxHR / h264 / hevc. The
other six are the color operators. Every node uses standard ComfyUI types (`IMAGE` / `MASK` / `FLOAT` /
`STRING`), so they interoperate with the whole ecosystem: pipe **OCIO Read** into any node, and any node into
**OCIO Write** (confirmed: OCIO Read -> core `ImageScaleBy` -> core `SaveImage` runs; core `LoadImage` -> OCIO
Write runs).

**Install:** `git clone https://github.com/SlavaSexton/ComfyUI-OCIO` into `custom_nodes`, then
`pip install -r ComfyUI-OCIO/requirements.txt` (`opencolorio`, `opencv-python-headless`, `tifffile`, `Pillow`,
`numpy`). `OCIOLogConvert` is the one node that is dependency-free (no OCIO needed).

**Two environment notes that bite:**
- **EXR:** OpenCV reads/writes EXR only with `OPENCV_IO_ENABLE_OPENEXR=1` set in the environment **before**
  ComfyUI starts (set it in the launcher). Without it, EXR read/write fails.
- **Video:** OCIO Read / Write shell out to **ffmpeg** (the codec engine for ProRes / DNxHR / h264 / hevc); it
  must be a full ffmpeg on `PATH`. Stills and sequences need no ffmpeg. Missing ffmpeg -> a clear "install
  ffmpeg" error, stills still work.

**Color model.** ComfyUI has no color management: it holds images as plain gamma-encoded **sRGB** in `0..1`
(LoadImage does `x/255`, no linearisation). This pack adds the pipeline. Working space = **`sRGB - Display`**;
OCIO Read converts files *into* it, OCIO Write converts *out* of it. Defaults follow the file type: **EXR ->
ACEScg** (scene-linear render space), **JPEG / PNG / TIFF -> sRGB - Display**. Colorspace names come from the
active config (built-in ACES **studio-config**, ~55 spaces incl. ARRI / RED / Sony camera spaces); drop a `.ocio`
in the input folder for a custom config.

**I/O status:** confirmed from the shipped pack source (we wrote it), verified at runtime via the ComfyUI
`/prompt` API against OpenColorIO 2.5.2 + the built-in ACES studio config. Read/Write exercised on a real
12-frame EXR sequence -> jpg (all 12 written), a ProRes clip round-trip (8 frames, fps preserved), missing-frame
fill (black / hold / error), alpha round-trip (RGBA 4-channel preserved), and the full example workflow
(all 8 nodes) end-to-end. **v1.0.1 additions** (`auto_colorspace`, `colorspace_in_name`, `compression`, the
`logc3` curve) re-confirmed from the shipped source this pass (io_nodes.py:599-604, nodes.py:245/261); the LTX
HDR -> ACEScg path + LogC3 round-trip were runtime-verified when v1.0.1 shipped (live `/prompt`:
`LTXVHDRDecodePostprocess` -> OCIO Write, HDR peak preserved; EXR compression across all 8 options; LogC3
round-trip max error ~5e-5).

## The IO pair

### OCIO Read  (display: "OCIO Read")
- **pack:** `ComfyUI-OCIO` | **category:** `OCIO` | **outputs:** `image/video` (IMAGE batch), `alpha` (MASK), `fps` (FLOAT), `info` (STRING)
- **purpose:** load a still / image sequence / video off disk and color-manage it on the way in (Nuke: Read).
- **inputs (widgets, no IMAGE input - it reads from disk):**
  - `source` (STRING) - a path to a file, a sequence **folder**, a frame **pattern** (`shot.####.exr`), or a video, ANYWHERE on disk (absolute like `D:\shots\shot.v01`, or relative to the ComfyUI input folder). A **browse-source** button (disk file/folder picker) and an **upload** button are added by the pack's JS.
  - `frame_mode` (combo `auto`/`single`/`sequence`) - auto: a numbered file with siblings loads the whole sequence (Nuke "grab sequence"); single: just that file; sequence: force-collapse siblings. A folder is always a sequence; a video is always its full clip.
  - `input_colorspace` (combo) - the colorspace the FILE is in (auto-suggested: EXR -> ACEScg, else sRGB - Display).
  - `output_colorspace` (combo) - the working space the IMAGE comes out in (default `sRGB - Display`).
  - `raw_data` (BOOLEAN) - skip the conversion, pass file values through untouched (Nuke Raw Data).
  - `start_frame` / `end_frame` (INT) - the frame-NUMBER range to load (auto-filled to the detected range; frames outside it are filled by `edge_mode`).
  - `frame_shift` (INT) - re-base: the number the FIRST frame becomes downstream (e.g. a 1001-start sequence -> 1). Flows to OCIO Write.
  - `missing_frames` (combo `black`/`hold`/`error`) - fill a gap inside the sequence: black frame / hold the previous / stop. Missing frames are auto-detected and listed on the node + in `info`.
  - `edge_mode` (combo `hold`/`loop`/`bounce`/`black`) - Nuke before/after: frames requested outside the original range.
  - `fps` (FLOAT) - taken from video metadata (24 for stills); flows to OCIO Write.
- **how it works:** detects single vs sequence, assembles a contiguous batch (fills missing/edge frames), reads via cv2 (EXR/DPX), tifffile (TIFF), PIL (PNG/JPG) or ffmpeg (video), splits RGB + alpha, then `config.getProcessor(input, output)` per frame unless `raw_data`.
- **anti-patterns:** the source combo is a STRING (any path) BY DESIGN - a real sequence lives at an absolute disk path, not the input folder; do not expect an input-folder dropdown. Setting `output_colorspace` to a linear space (e.g. ACEScg) can emit values > 1, which stock ComfyUI nodes clip - keep the default `sRGB - Display` for downstream stock nodes.
- **placement:** the start of a graph, in place of `LoadImage`, when you need a sequence / video / color-managed load.

### OCIO Write  (display: "OCIO Write")
- **pack:** `ComfyUI-OCIO` | **category:** `OCIO` | **OUTPUT_NODE** | **output:** `path` (STRING)
- **purpose:** color-manage an IMAGE batch and write it to disk (Nuke: Write).
- **inputs:**
  - `images` (IMAGE) - the frame batch. `alpha` (MASK, optional) - wire OCIO Read's alpha (or any MASK) to write RGBA. `fps` (FLOAT, optional) - wire OCIO Read's fps.
  - **`input_colorspace`** (combo) - the working space of the incoming image (default `sRGB - Display`). **RENAMED from `from_colorspace` in v1.3.0; an API-format graph carrying the old key is refused with HTTP 400.** See the v1.3.0 section at the top.
  - `output_colorspace` (combo) - the file's colorspace. Format picks the default (EXR -> ACEScg, PNG/TIFF/JPEG -> sRGB); stamped into the file metadata where the format allows.
  - `container` (combo `still image`/`sequence`/`video`).
  - `still_format` (combo `exr`/`tiff`/`png`/`jpeg`) - for still/sequence. `video_codec` (combo `prores_4444`/`prores_422hq`/`prores_422`/`dnxhr_hq`/`h264`/`hevc`) - for video. The pack's JS shows only the relevant one per container.
  - `bit_depth` (combo) - narrows to the format: JPEG 8; PNG 8/16; TIFF 8/16/32f; EXR 16f/32f.
  - `auto_range` (BOOLEAN) - pull `first_frame`/`last_frame`/`start_number`/`fps` automatically from the OCIO Read at the far end of the wire (through any number of nodes). Editing them by hand turns it off.
  - `first_frame`/`last_frame` (INT) - which frames to write. `start_number` (INT) - the number on the first output file. `source_start` (INT, hidden, set by the wire) - maps frame numbers to batch indices.
  - `raw_data` (BOOLEAN) - write as-is, no conversion. `output_folder` (STRING, browse button) + `filename` (STRING).
  - `colorspace_in_name` (BOOLEAN, default ON, **v1.0.1**) - put the output colorspace in the file name, BEFORE the frame number: `name_acescg.0086.exr`. Uses a short sanitized tag of `output_colorspace` (e.g. `acescg`, `rec709`, `srgb`, `logc`), or `raw` when Raw Data is on. Off -> plain `name.0086.exr`.
  - `auto_colorspace` (BOOLEAN, default ON, **v1.0.1**, front-end only) - when the input is wired from LTX's `LTXVHDRDecodePostprocess` (their SDR->HDR decode), auto-sets `input_colorspace = "Linear Rec.709 (sRGB)"` and `output_colorspace = "ACEScg"` for you. Editing either colorspace by hand still wins.
  - `compression` (combo, default `zip`, **v1.0.1**, EXR only) - Nuke-Write-style EXR compression: `zip` / `zips` = lossless (default), `piz` = lossless and good for grain, `dwaa` / `dwab` = smaller but lossy, plus `pxr24` / `rle` / `none`.
- **how it works:** converts from->out (unless raw_data), then writes: EXR via cv2 (half/float, RGBA, chosen `compression`), TIFF via tifffile, PNG/JPEG via cv2/PIL, video via ffmpeg (rgb48le pipe -> the codec). Returns a preview of the first written frame (a wrong colorspace pick looks visibly wrong) + "wrote N frames". A Render button queues the graph.
- **naming:** with `colorspace_in_name` ON (default) the colorspace tag sits before the number - still `<name>_<cs>.<ext>`; sequence `<name>_<cs>.0086.<ext>, <name>_<cs>.0087.<ext>, ...`; video `<name>_<cs>.mov` / `.mp4`. OFF -> `<name>.<ext>` / `<name>.0086.<ext>` / `<name>.mov`.
- **anti-patterns:** EXR needs the OPENCV env var (above); video needs ffmpeg; JPEG ignores alpha. It writes to the SERVER disk, not the browser - the browse button lists server folders.
- **placement:** the end of a graph, in place of `SaveImage`, when you need a color-managed / sequence / video / RGBA / ProRes save.

## The six color operators

### OCIOColorSpace  (display: "OCIO ColorSpace")
- **inputs:** `image` (IMAGE); `in_colorspace` / `out_colorspace` (combo of the config's spaces); `mix` (FLOAT 0..1, blend with the original); `config_path` (combo, optional). A **swap** button flips in/out.
- **purpose / how:** convert between two OCIO colorspaces; `config.getProcessor(in, out)` per frame, blended by `mix`.
- **anti-patterns:** the names must exist in the active config; a typo or a name from another config errors. Needs OpenColorIO + a config.
- **placement:** anywhere a colorspace change is needed - the OCIO workhorse.

### OCIOLogConvert  (display: "OCIO LogConvert")  -- the log-space transform node, dependency-free
- **inputs:** `image` (IMAGE); `operation` (combo `lin_to_log`/`log_to_lin`); `curve` (combo `cineon`/`acescct`/`acescc`/`logc3`, **`logc3` new in v1.0.1**); `mix` (FLOAT). A **swap** button flips the direction.
- **purpose:** linear <-> log so manual geometry (scale, rotate, warp, resample) preserves highlight/shadow detail instead of crushing it in linear light. **This is the node for the log-space technique in `color-and-transform.md`.**
- **curves (published specs, verified by round-trip):** `cineon` = Nuke's flat film log, black `0 -> 0.0928` (matches Nuke's default); `acescct` = ACES log with a toe (black `0.0729`, S-2016-001); `acescc` = pure ACES log (S-2014-003); **`logc3` = ARRI LogC3 EI800**, the tonal curve LTX-2's HDR IC-LoRA uses (black `0 -> 0.0928`). Use `log_to_lin` with `logc3` to decode an LTX LogC3 HDR plate to linear, KEEP the Rec.709 primaries, then convert Rec.709 -> ACEScg with OCIO ColorSpace (do NOT use a config "ARRI LogC3" space - that assumes ARRI Wide Gamut and shifts the gamut).
- **anti-patterns:** do NOT run AI / diffusion / VAE in log; do not round-trip at 8-bit; wrap once around the whole transform block; feed LINEAR for `lin_to_log` (linearize sRGB first).
- **placement:** wrap tightly around manual geometry.

### OCIODisplay  (display: "OCIO Display")
- **inputs:** `image` (IMAGE); `in_colorspace` (combo); `display` (combo of the config's displays, e.g. "sRGB - Display"); `view` (combo, e.g. "ACES 2.0 - SDR 100 nits (Rec.709)"); `invert_direction` (BOOLEAN); `mix` (FLOAT); `config_path` (optional).
- **purpose / how:** apply a display + view transform (scene-referred -> display-referred, e.g. ACEScg -> the ACES SDR view on an sRGB monitor). `OCIO.DisplayViewTransform` per frame.
- **anti-patterns:** a viewing/output transform, not a working-space convert - do not feed its output back into a linear pipeline; `display`/`view` must be valid for the config.
- **placement:** near the end, before save/preview, to bake a display look.

### OCIOCDLTransform  (display: "OCIO CDLTransform")
- **inputs:** `image` (IMAGE); `slope_r/g/b`, `offset_r/g/b`, `power_r/g/b` (FLOAT); `saturation` (FLOAT); `direction` (combo forward/inverse); `mix` (FLOAT).
- **purpose / how:** an ASC CDL primary grade (per-channel slope/offset/power + saturation); `OCIO.CDLTransform`, config-independent.
- **anti-patterns:** CDL math assumes a defined working space (usually log or a grade space); on raw linear it looks different than a colorist expects.
- **placement:** the primary-grade step in a color chain.

### OCIOFileTransform  (display: "OCIO FileTransform")
- **inputs:** `image` (IMAGE); `file_path` (combo of LUTs in the input folder - `.cube`/`.3dl`/`.spi1d`/`.spi3d`/`.csp`/`.ccc`/`.cdl`/`.clf`; an **upload** button adds one); `interpolation` (combo linear/nearest/tetrahedral/best); `direction` (forward/inverse); `mix` (FLOAT).
- **purpose:** apply an external LUT / CCC / CDL file (a show or camera LUT).
- **anti-patterns:** the LUT expects a specific input space - the wrong space gives wrong color; `tetrahedral` for 3D LUTs, `linear` for 1D; the file must exist in the input folder (or upload it).
- **placement:** wherever a show/camera LUT belongs in the chain.

### OCIOLookTransform  (display: "OCIO LookTransform")
- **inputs:** `image` (IMAGE); `in_colorspace` / `out_colorspace` (combo); `look` (combo of the config's looks, e.g. "ACES 1.3 Reference Gamut Compression"); `invert_direction` (BOOLEAN); `mix` (FLOAT); `config_path` (optional). A **swap** button flips in/out.
- **purpose / how:** apply a named OCIO "look" (a creative grade defined in the config); `OCIO.LookTransform`.
- **anti-patterns:** the look name(s) must be defined in the active config.
- **placement:** the creative-look step, after primaries, before display.

## Worked example - color-managed sequence to ProRes

An EXR render sequence to a graded ProRes, the Nuke way:

```
OCIO Read (source=D:\shots\beauty.####.exr, input=ACEScg, output=sRGB - Display, frame_mode=auto)
  -> [any ComfyUI work, or a color operator, e.g. OCIO CDLTransform for a primary grade]
  -> OCIO Write (from=sRGB - Display, output=Rec.1886 Rec.709 - Display, container=video,
                 video_codec=prores_4444, auto_range=ON, filename=beauty_graded)
```

`auto_range=ON` pulls the frame range + fps from OCIO Read through the wire, so the ProRes carries the right
count and rate. The example workflow `example_workflows/OCIO_Nodes.json` in the repo shows the pre-Player eight
nodes on one image (copy its `nyc_skyline.png` + `warm_demo.cube` into ComfyUI's input folder, then open it); the
9th node **OCIO Player** and the native VIDEO sockets (v1.2.0) are covered in "New in v1.2.0" above.

## Worked example (v1.0.1) - LTX-2 HDR video to an ACEScg EXR sequence

LTX-2's HDR IC-LoRA emits an HDR plate on a Rec.709 gamut with an ARRI LogC3 tonal curve. To land it in a VFX
master format (scene-linear ACEScg EXR), two ways - both write `name_acescg.####.exr`:

**Method A - automatic (fewest nodes):** wire OCIO Write straight to LTX's HDR decode.
```
[LTX-2 HDR sampler -> VAE Decode] -> LTXVHDRDecodePostprocess (hdr_linear out)
  -> OCIO Write (auto_colorspace=ON -> auto-sets from="Linear Rec.709 (sRGB)", output="ACEScg";
                 container=sequence, still_format=exr, compression=zip, colorspace_in_name=ON)
```
`auto_colorspace` detects the LTX HDR decode upstream and fills the two colorspaces, so Write converts
Rec.709 -> ACEScg on the way out.

**Method B - manual (explicit, full control):** decode the LogC3 curve yourself, then set the gamut.
```
[VAE Decode of the HDR plate]
  -> OCIO LogConvert (operation=log_to_lin, curve=logc3)   # LogC3 -> linear, KEEP Rec.709 primaries
  -> OCIO ColorSpace (in="Linear Rec.709 (sRGB)", out="ACEScg")   # gamut Rec.709 -> ACEScg
  -> OCIO Write (from="ACEScg", output="ACEScg", container=sequence, still_format=exr)

Both need `OPENCV_IO_ENABLE_OPENEXR=1` (EXR write) and produce an ACEScg-tagged 16f/32f EXR sequence. Do NOT
route through a config "ARRI LogC3" colorspace - that assumes ARRI Wide Gamut and shifts the gamut; the LTX plate
is Rec.709.

**Building a graph with these nodes:** lay it out with `workflow_layout.py` like any other (see SKILL.md) - OCIO
Read has no input and four outputs, OCIO Write is an output node; a linear Read -> operators -> Write chain lays
out cleanly left to right.
