# ComfyUI-Krea2Edit

Instruction-based image editing for **Krea 2** in ComfyUI — the node pack that powers
the **Krea 2 Identity Edit** LoRA. Turns Krea 2 (Raw or Turbo) into an image editor with dual
conditioning: the source image is injected both as VAE latent tokens (appearance) and
into the Qwen3-VL text encoder (semantic grounding), matching how the LoRA was trained.

☕ **[Support on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/conradlocke)** — all tips go straight to GPU compute for future versions.

🧰 **Training code is public:** [krea2edit-trainer](https://github.com/lbouaraba/krea2edit-trainer) — the ai-toolkit extension these LoRAs were trained with, geometry-matched to the nodes, with measured consumer-GPU VRAM requirements.

## Model versions

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) — **v1.2 is recommended** (better face likeness,
plus the new `fit` reference geometry and `ref_boost` fidelity dial).

## Installation

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/lbouaraba/comfyui-krea2edit
# restart ComfyUI
```

Requirements: a ComfyUI version with native Krea 2 support, the Krea 2 model
(Raw or Turbo), the Qwen3-VL 4B text encoder used by Krea 2, and the Krea 2 Identity Edit
LoRA (`krea2_identity_edit_v1_2.safetensors`). No extra Python dependencies.

## Nodes

### `Krea2EditModelPatch`
Wraps the diffusion model so the VAE-encoded source image is prepended as clean
in-context tokens (RoPE frame 1). Inputs:
- `model` — Krea 2 (LoRA already applied)
- `source_latent` — VAEEncode of the image being edited
- `source_latent_b` *(optional)* — second reference (RoPE frame 2) for two-input
  edits (e.g. person + scene)
- `vae` + `source_image` *(optional, recommended)* — the blur-proof pixel path: give
  the raw image (and VAE) and the node fits it to the target grid in pixel space.
  Required for `fit_mode: fit`.
- `target_latent` *(optional, recommended whenever you use the pixel path)* — wire the
  **same** latent you feed `KSampler.latent_image`. It only tells the node the output
  resolution ahead of time, so the source can be VAE-encoded here instead of on the first
  sampling step. Skipping it can cost real speed — see [Pixel path and VRAM](#pixel-path-and-vram).
- `fit_mode` *(default `fit`)* — how a source fits a mismatched output aspect ratio.
  `fit` = training-matched resample at a centered offset (v1.2); `crop` = center-crop,
  the v1/v1.1-legacy geometry (use with older weights).
- `ref_boost` *(default 1.0)* — reference-fidelity dial; >1 pulls harder toward the
  reference's appearance, <1 loosens. `ref_boost_a` is the same dial for the scene ref in two-ref edits.

### `Krea2EditGroundedEncode`
Image-grounded instruction encoding — the text encoder *sees* the image while
reading your instruction, exactly as during training. Inputs:
- `clip` — the Krea 2 CLIP (Qwen3-VL, loaded with `type: krea2`)
- `prompt` — the edit instruction ("recolor the car to matte black")
- `image` — the same source image
- `image_b` *(optional)* — second reference for two-input edits
- `grounding_px` — grounding resolution (default 768; v1.2 trained range
  384–768, and 1024+ often still works nicely). This is a quality dial: lower =
  stronger edit adherence, higher = stronger identity/likeness. Try 1024 for
  people, 512 for stubborn scene changes. (v1's trained range was 512–1536.)

**Both nodes are required.** With a stock `CLIPTextEncode` the model never sees the
image semantically and quality drops sharply, especially for scene-referential
instructions ("the man on the left").

## Minimal wiring

```
LoadImage ─┬─ VAEEncode ── Krea2EditModelPatch.source_latent
           └─ Krea2EditGroundedEncode.image     (+ your prompt)
UNETLoader ── LoraLoaderModelOnly (krea2_identity_edit_v1_2 @1.0) ── Krea2EditModelPatch.model
Krea2EditModelPatch ── KSampler.model
Krea2EditGroundedEncode ── KSampler.positive
Krea2EditGroundedEncode (empty prompt, same image) ── KSampler.negative
EmptySD3LatentImage ─┬─ KSampler.latent_image
                     └─ Krea2EditModelPatch.target_latent   (when using vae + source_image)
```

Example workflow in `workflows/`: `krea2_identity_edit.json` — single-image editor by
default; enable group 2 (toggle its Bypass off) for two-image person-into-scene edits.

## Usage notes (read these — they matter)

1. **Aspect ratio.** With `fit_mode: fit` (default in v1.2) and `vae` + `source_image`
   connected, mismatched source/output aspect ratios are handled — the source is
   resampled to the target grid. On `crop`/legacy weights, still match the AR: a
   mismatched AR is out of distribution and degrades identity/preservation.
2. **Turbo, 8 steps, CFG 1** is the fast path (~1 min at 2MP) and works for most
   edits: recolor, add/insert, attribute changes, restyles, scene translation.
3. **Removals and other "delete salient content" edits need real guidance:**
   use the **Raw** model at **CFG 3, ~20 steps**. Distilled Turbo at CFG 1 will
   usually re-render the subject instead of removing it.
4. At CFG > 1, ground the negative too: a second `Krea2EditGroundedEncode` with an
   empty prompt and the same image (this is the trained unconditional).
5. Two-input edits: scene image → `source_latent`/`image`, subject image →
   `source_latent_b`/`image_b`. Leave the b-inputs unconnected for single-image use.
6. **Generate at ≤2MP.** Above the trained range, source content can bleed into
   the output or subjects duplicate.
7. **Two distinct people:** place both references in a single pass (scene/subject A on
   the main inputs, subject B on the `_b` inputs) rather than adding them one at a time —
   simultaneous placement is currently more reliable than chaining separate edits. Face
   separation is still imperfect and a focus for future versions.
8. **Wire `target_latent` if you use `vae` + `source_image`** — see below.

## Pixel path and VRAM

The pixel path has to VAE-encode the source at the output resolution. Without
`target_latent` the node doesn't know that resolution until sampling starts, so the
encode runs on the first step — and `vae.encode` asks ComfyUI for VRAM at a moment when
the diffusion model is already resident and mid-run. ComfyUI frees room by partially
offloading whatever is loaded, the sampler included, and nothing loads it back (it loads
once, before its loop). The rest of the run then streams weights from CPU on every step.

Wiring `target_latent` moves the encode to node-execution time, restoring the normal
`VAEEncode → KSampler` order where the sampler evicts the VAE rather than the reverse.
The encode is cached either way, so this is purely about *when* it happens.

If you have VRAM headroom for the model and the VAE at once, nothing gets offloaded and
neither wiring costs you anything — which is why this only bites some setups. Wire it
anyway; it's free.

The console tells you which path you got:

```
[krea2edit] pre-encoding sources at target 128x128 (before sampling, fit_mode=fit)   <- good
[krea2edit] NOTE: connect 'target_latent' ...                                        <- encode will land mid-sampling
```

**Measure over 20+ steps, not 1.** The source still has to be VAE-encoded either way —
`target_latent` only changes *when*. What it removes is a per-step penalty, so it can
only show up across many steps. A 1-step run is almost entirely fixed overhead (model
load, text encode, VAE encode/decode) and will show no difference at all.

A third option is to skip the pixel path entirely: resize your source image to exactly
the output resolution and feed only `source_latent`. At matched resolution the latent
path does no resampling and produces the same reference geometry.
